Ol' mother earth<SEP>They have made so many scars upon your face And the beauty you once had can never be replaced Long for wild earth You were pounted by the meters from the sky But you did no die And now the ones that you have loved Are taking you for granted Here they're so inchanted By the progress they can make They never stop to think Just how much that you can take Mother earth<SEP>Take us back to when the proud ones lived They only took what you would give Mother earth<SEP>Tonight before I lay my body down I'll pray to the Lord that a way can be found And if bad goes to works The Lord help me try to do my best Until once again, mother earth You hold me to your breast
