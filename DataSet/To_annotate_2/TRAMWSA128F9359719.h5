When I was a lad and Old Shep was a pup<SEP>O'er hills and meadows we'd stray<SEP>Just a boy and his dog, we both full of fun<SEP>We grew up together that way<SEP>I remember the time at the old swimmin' hole<SEP>When I would have drowned beyond doubt<SEP>Shep was right there, to the rescue he came<SEP>He jumped in and helped pull me out<SEP>So the years sped along and at last he grew old<SEP>His eyesight was fast growin' dim<SEP>Then one day, the doctor looked at me and said"<SEP>I can't do no more for him, Jim"<SEP>With a hand that was tremblin', I picked up my gun<SEP>I aimed it at Shep's faithful head<SEP>I just couldn't do it, I wanted to run<SEP>And I wished they'd shoot me instead<SEP>I went to his side and I sat on the ground<SEP>He laid his head on my knee<SEP>I stroked the best pal that a man ever found<SEP>I cried, so I scarcely could see<SEP>Old Sheppie, he knew he was goin' to go<SEP>For he reached out and licked at my hand<SEP>He looked up at me, just as much as to say"<SEP>We're partin' but you understand"<SEP>Now Old Shep is gone where the good doggies go<SEP>And no more with Old Shep will I roam<SEP>But if dogs have a Heaven, there's one thing I know<SEP>Old Shep has a wonderful home
