Face to face, we've come from lands undone.<SEP>We bend and twist this broken mess, yet to see the sun.<SEP>And now soon you'll see the glory. And I'm proof of living dead.<SEP>Destroy what you've built, give up the will.(<SEP>Trust me, cause so far I've stood strong.<SEP>Trust me cause so far I've stood tall.<SEP>Just listen when I say.)<SEP>This is how we live. This is what we breathe.<SEP>And it's insulting to my face. It's something I'll take under my wing,<SEP>I will fly until I sing this free. (<SEP>Stop, surrender to fate.)<SEP>A servant to your dreams, this blood will spill.<SEP>Ruining your dreams that I despise,<SEP>I will not strike till I see the whites of your eyes.<SEP>And only then you'll feel the fury.<SEP>And I'm proof of living dead.<SEP>This is the one that is the answer to our lives. Look ahead,<SEP>And even if this never works,(<SEP>I'll be) satisfied with every motion.<SEP>And now I am sure I was right.
