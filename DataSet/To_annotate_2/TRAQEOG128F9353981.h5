In a rusted red Chevy with a heart full of glory<SEP>She left that night<SEP>A suitcase at the door open wide let the cold air come in<SEP>And then she asked me for a light<SEP>Said she had some old business see an old friend<SEP>Or maybe make a new start<SEP>But the words of her reason they changed with the season<SEP>And the truth burned in my heart<SEP>It blew me away and I thought I'd go crazy'<SEP>Cause I knew even then I was caught<SEP>I'm caught in the rain again<SEP>I pray to the Heavens to defend me<SEP>I'm caught in the rain<SEP>Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?<SEP>So I listen to the wind for the answer<SEP>Time hangs heavy on my face<SEP>I run from the storm that's on it's way<SEP>Until I find there is no place<SEP>No person, no thing I can run to, no shelter I can gain from the rain<SEP>Yes I know this time it's too late, now'<SEP>Cause I'm caught in the rain again<SEP>And I pray to the Heavens to defend me<SEP>I'm caught in the rain<SEP>Why's it seem like more rain that they send me? And they send me<SEP>And the rain comes down so silently<SEP>And time stand's still like it's in front of me<SEP>And the years turn to the rain<SEP>And this silence kills me<SEP>So now in this one horse town bar<SEP>I sing in the back room in the December night<SEP>Here she comes through the doorway<SEP>With a blustering wind that's too cold to forget<SEP>She looks like she knew me<SEP>The heat shot through me, melted me down<SEP>So we sat and talked about the old days<SEP>Or any new things that we found<SEP>Talked about the days when we were so much younger and innocent<SEP>We saw it plain, we were just caught in the rain<SEP>We're caught in the rain again<SEP>I pray to the Heavens to defend me<SEP>Caught in the rain<SEP>Why's it seem like more rain that they send me?<SEP>I'm out here on my knees<SEP>And my love knows I've been trying<SEP>Still I'm caught in the rain on these old fool ideas I'm relying<SEP>So I guess she gets me the rain again
