When the moon comes up the sun goes down<SEP>Rita starts to creep around<SEP>Gets a flame in her blood fire on her breath<SEP>Fourteen names notched on her chest<SEP>She gotta rose tattooed on her thigh<SEP>Dead men raise and sigh<SEP>And it drives my young blood wild<SEP>My baby's got the Cadillac walk<SEP>When Rita turns down her bed<SEP>Grown men plead and beg<SEP>Baby honey baby you're the one<SEP>Carve your name right on my gun<SEP>Ain't she something nice<SEP>Bones rattle my dice<SEP>I slobber down my side<SEP>My baby's got the Cadillac walk<SEP>Lonely tonight honey hear my call<SEP>She said boy I won't make you crawl<SEP>Rita pound by pound<SEP>Knows how to work it down<SEP>Weep and cry to and fro<SEP>Leave your heart she'll steal your gold<SEP>No matter what the cost<SEP>Ooh... them duel exhaust<SEP>Make my motor sigh<SEP>My baby's got the Cadillac walk
