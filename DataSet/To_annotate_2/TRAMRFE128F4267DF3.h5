I was a stoned drunk silhouette of my past I lost my nerves when he took me on He was this high-healed smooth talking middleclass bastard Who tried to stab me for where I was from And though his words was covered in yesterdays mud The boys around him laugh his way But on the parking lot where I was born He didn't come to play No he didn't dare to stay You think you're better than us You think you're better than who You think you're better than Annie's angle You think you're down with the people who laugh when you frown And then move from ground to ground You think you're better than us You think you're better than who You think you're talking to Annie's angle You think you're down with the people who laugh when you frown And then move from ground to ground Such a pit no one's hurt from your punch Must be a drag to look so debased On the other side you've still got your kids to die for So why take it all out on me That angry look doesn't suite your face You've got your medals in a box And on the telly there's this leader saying ' Blame it on the boss You've got to blame it on the boss You think you're better than us You think you're better than who You think you're better than Annie's angle You think you're down with the people who laugh when you frown And then move from ground to ground You think you're better than us You think you're better than who You think you're talking to Annie's angle You think you're down with the people who laugh when you frown And then move from ground to ground<SEP>And then move from ground to ground<SEP>And then move from ground to ground
