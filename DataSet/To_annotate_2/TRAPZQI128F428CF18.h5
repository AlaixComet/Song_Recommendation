I must be out of my mind as I hear you call<SEP>My name is even though I can't see you anywhere<SEP>Surely this feeling is coming from something<SEP>Someone gave me yesterday as I searched for you<SEP>And I hear you call<SEP>I hear you call my name<SEP>But when I turn around<SEP>There's nothing to be found<SEP>I must be dreaming a dream of a lunatic<SEP>My fingers taste like some strawberry icecream<SEP>I hear you call my name but I don't think it's<SEP>The same I heard you whisper in my ear
