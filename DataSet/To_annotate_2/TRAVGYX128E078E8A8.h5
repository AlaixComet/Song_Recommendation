The innocence of sleeping children dressed in white and slowly dreaming stops all time<SEP>I slow my steps and start to blur, so many years have filled my heart, I never thought I'd say those words(<SEP>The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show<SEP>The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show)<SEP>The very first time I saw your face I thought of a song and quickly changed the tune<SEP>The very first time I touched your skin I thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon<SEP>Oh, remember. Oh, please don't change<SEP>So the fall came, thirteen years, a shiny ring and how I could forget your name<SEP>The air no longer in my throat, another perfect lie is choked but it always feels the same<SEP>So they close together, dressed in red and yellow, innocent forever. Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms still dream(<SEP>The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show<SEP>The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show)
