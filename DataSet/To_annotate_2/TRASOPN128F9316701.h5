Awaken from the bliss of sleep<SEP>The daybreak haunts you in such a subtle light<SEP>I hear them, they tell me these roads we have travelled<SEP>Fork up beyond the bend<SEP>Beneath the flutter of desperate wings<SEP>They sing a song of reclamation<SEP>Where tomorrows hanging horizon<SEP>Interrupts the hum of electrical towers<SEP>Here, there are the shallow graves<SEP>The shallower romances<SEP>And the shallowest of words still to be spoken<SEP>And there you are with open ears<SEP>Locust reign on your parade
