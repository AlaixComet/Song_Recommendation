With death in my hands I'll clean myself of all this filth scratching out the stains of a lying tongue that spoke, as chords from the string I'll pull myself out of this and cast this life of shit into the flood and rise above where I belong.<SEP>Drenched in self-righteousness I'm letting go of apathy, I won't put up the front of a victim anymore.<SEP>So sick of cheap excuses from everyone I know I'm scattering the ashes of who I was.<SEP>Letting go of the person I used to be looking back and laughing at what I once believe.<SEP>Escaping the plagues of my life, and letting go of my regret, I'm casting my past in the flood forgetting every line we spent.<SEP>With death in my hands I'll clean myself of this. (2x)<SEP>Scratching out the stains of every lie that you spoke, sarcasm infecting everything you say, with my scarred hands I'll pull myself out and rise above all this where I belong, from my scarred hands I am reborn.
