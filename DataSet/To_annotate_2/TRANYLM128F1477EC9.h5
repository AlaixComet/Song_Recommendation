You know, the sun is in your eyes<SEP>And hurricanes and rains<SEP>And black and cloudy skies.<SEP>You're running up and down that hill.<SEP>You turn it on and off at will.<SEP>There's nothing here to thrill<SEP>Or bring you down.<SEP>And if you've got no other choice<SEP>You know you can follow my voice<SEP>Through the dark turns and noise<SEP>Of this wicked little town.<SEP>Oh Lady, luck has led you here<SEP>And they're so twisted up<SEP>They'll twist you up. I fear.<SEP>The pious, hateful and devout,<SEP>You're turning tricks till you're turned out,<SEP>The wind so cold it burns,<SEP>You're burning out<SEP>And blowing round.<SEP>And if you've got no other choice<SEP>You know you can follow my voice<SEP>Through the dark turns and noise<SEP>Of this wicked little town.<SEP>The fates are vicious<SEP>And they're cruel.<SEP>You learn too late you've used two wishes like a fool<SEP>And then you're someone you are not,<SEP>And Junction City ain't the spot,<SEP>Remember Mrs. Lot<SEP>And when she turned around.<SEP>And if you've got no other choice<SEP>You know you can follow my voice<SEP>Through the dark turns and noise<SEP>Of this wicked little town.
