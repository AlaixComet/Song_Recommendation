There are few who'd deny, at what I do I am the best<SEP>For my talents are renowned far and wide (wide)<SEP>When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night<SEP>I excel without ever even trying<SEP>With the slightest little effort of my ghostlike charms<SEP>I have seen grown men give out a shriek<SEP>With the wave of my hand and a well-placed moan<SEP>I have swept the very bravest off their feet<SEP>Yet year after year, it's the same routine<SEP>And I grow so weary of the sound of screams<SEP>And I, Jack, the Pumpkin King<SEP>Have grown so tired of the same old thing<SEP>Oh, somewhere deep inside of these bones<SEP>An emptiness began to grow<SEP>There's something out there, far from my home<SEP>A longing that I've never known<SEP>I'm a master of fright and a demon of light<SEP>And I'll scare you right out of your pants<SEP>To a guy in Kentucky, I'm Mister Unlucky<SEP>And I'm known throughout England and France<SEP>And since I am dead, I can take off my head<SEP>To recite Shakespearean quotations<SEP>No animal nor man can scream like I can<SEP>With the fury of my recitations<SEP>But who here would ever understand<SEP>That the Pumpkin King with the skeleton grin<SEP>Would tire of his crown, if they only understood<SEP>He'd give it all up if he only could<SEP>Oh, there's an empty place in my bones<SEP>That calls out for something unknown<SEP>The fame and praise come year after year<SEP>Does nothing for these empty tears
