I walk on misty pathways.<SEP>Where my journey leads I do not know.<SEP>I just follow my inner voice.<SEP>Longer and longer on misty pathways I go.<SEP>I travel into an unknown vale.<SEP>Through forests over hills and far away.<SEP>The chilly breezes of night surrounds me<SEP>With their smooth gentle touches.<SEP>The fog hides the path<SEP>Which I walk upon.<SEP>Voices I hear from inside the dark<SEP>And dusky the night have laid.<SEP>Observed by the forgotten shadowpeople I am<SEP>As I wander through their realm.<SEP>The silvery cold moon looks upon me.<SEP>As I strive through these spellbound forests.
