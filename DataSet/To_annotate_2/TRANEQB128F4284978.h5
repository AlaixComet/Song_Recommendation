Tumbling curls of green by stained glass streaming light,<SEP>And a yellow coloured lampshade-used to keep us up all night,<SEP>And the smile upon your face, a tear upon your cheek,<SEP>And the night sky on the window-your heart calling out to me.<SEP>Come running home again Katie, come running home again,<SEP>Cross my heart and hope to die, shall I cause another tear from your eye?<SEP>The mirror that wont talk and your nightgown on the door,<SEP>The old pedal singer just don't sing no more,<SEP>You can roll the reels for hours, from the movie from this book,<SEP>It's a question mark on this heart of mine, sends an elder back to look.<SEP>Chorus (followed by immediate): Katie.<SEP>Now I'm looking through a tunnel back into the room,<SEP>With the genius of a Druid, when the sunlight floods the tomb,<SEP>And I'm never going back there, and I couldn't any way,'<SEP>Cause though I made the great escape, I never got away.
