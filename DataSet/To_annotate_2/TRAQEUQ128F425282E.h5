Fly high my black eagle<SEP>Let golden thread bind our eyes<SEP>May our minds and hearts blood unite<SEP>On your wings carry me over the abyss<SEP>Beyond the reason and across the burning seas<SEP>Then, with your claw tear the earth<SEP>And usher me into the secrets of her bowels<SEP>Down to the light of the beginning and the end which shimmers<SEP>Circle round and round, my black eagle<SEP>Let our senses be touched by ultimate pleasure<SEP>May the passion of hunting become all-devouring<SEP>Slash with your beak<SEP>Remove all gods from my way, and thoughts, and sorrows<SEP>And let me trespass the barriers of fear<SEP>Scream! The whole cosmos tremble<SEP>May echoes become my sweetest mantra<SEP>Spirit of freedom! Eternal wanderer! Joyful solitude!<SEP>Higher and higher towards the stars of awareness<SEP>Let worlds of imagination and fact become one<SEP>When I'm you and you are me
