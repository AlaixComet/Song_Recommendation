These are the days, the days we never thought we'd see. This is the end, of the way we think that things should be.<SEP>Our time is running out, our time is now, this time we're seeing through clear eyes, we're taking back what is ours. With lessons still left to learn, this it's our turn, we're taking back what is ours.<SEP>Who will remember all of the things, the things we have forgotten? Who will right the things, the things that we've done wrong? Who will the hearts of those who hurt? Who will be His hands? Who will go?<SEP>These are the days we thought would last forever. These are the days thought would never, ever end.<SEP>These days will never be the same, familiar faces with different names.
