Dry bread on the table Burn the mill, salt the paper And it's easy pick-ins on Locust Street There's no place to hide And you can't find love on Locust Street But you can hear the sunrise crying Can't you hear the sunrise crying A song for you alone Sad eyes, weeping willow<SEP>Black cat blues, blacked out window<SEP>And it's easy pick-ins on Locust Street There's no place to hide And you can't find love on Locust Street But you can hear the sunrise crying Can't you hear the sunrise crying A song for you alone Just a glimpse of what love could be Once a dream that I owned What of many lonely longing souls At least I'm not alone Well at least I'm not alone Ripe off the vine now lay rotten<SEP>Like a dead end street forever forgotten<SEP>And it's easy pick-ins on Locust Street There's no place to hide<SEP>And you can't find love on Locust Street<SEP>But you can hear the sunrise crying<SEP>Can't you hear the sunrise crying<SEP>Can't you hear the sunrise crying<SEP>A song for you alone<SEP>A song for you alone
