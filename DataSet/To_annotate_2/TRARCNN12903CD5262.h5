Reuben James, in my song you'll live again<SEP>And the phrases that I rhyme are just a footstep out of time<SEP>From the time when I knew you, Reuben James<SEP>Reuben James, all the folks around Madison County<SEP>Cussed your name<SEP>You're just a no-account, sharecropping colored man<SEP>Who'd steal anything he can<SEP>And everybody laid the blame on Reuben James<SEP>Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind<SEP>Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow<SEP>I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James<SEP>Flora Grey, the gossip of Madison County died with child<SEP>Although your skin was black<SEP>You were the one that didn't turn your back<SEP>On the hungry white child with no name, Reuben James<SEP>Reuben James, with your mind on my soul<SEP>And a Bible in your right hand<SEP>You said turn the other cheek<SEP>For there's a better world awaiting for the meek<SEP>In my mind, these words remain from Reuben James<SEP>Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind<SEP>Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow<SEP>I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James<SEP>Reuben James, one dark cloudy day<SEP>They brought you from the field<SEP>Unto your lonely pine box came<SEP>Just a preacher, me, and the rain<SEP>Just to sing one last refrain to Reuben James<SEP>Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind<SEP>Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow<SEP>I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James<SEP>Reuben James, you still walk the furrowed fields of my mind<SEP>Faded shirt, weathered brow, calloused hands upon the plow<SEP>I loved you then and I love you now, Reuben James
