Your words go through and through me<SEP>And leave me totally dazed<SEP>For they do such strange things to me<SEP>They nearly make me gloomy<SEP>For you dear are so clever<SEP>So obviously the top<SEP>I wish you'd go on forever<SEP>I wish even more you'd stop<SEP>Oh it's bad for me it's bad for me<SEP>The knowledge that you're going mad for me<SEP>I feel certain my friends would be glad for me<SEP>But it's bad for me<SEP>It's so good for me so new for me<SEP>To see someone in such a stew for me<SEP>And when you say you'll do all you could for me<SEP>It's so good for me it's bad for me<SEP>I felt till you whispered to me<SEP>Completely left on the shelf<SEP>But since you started to woo me<SEP>I'm just crazy about myself<SEP>It's a boon for me a break for me<SEP>To hear that your heart's on the make for me<SEP>Yet no matter however appealing<SEP>I still have a feeling it's bad for me<SEP>It's so sweet for me it's swell for me<SEP>To feel that you're going through hell for me<SEP>Yet no matter however appealing<SEP>I still have a feeling it's bad for me
