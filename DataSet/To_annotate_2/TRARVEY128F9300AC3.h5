I know what lies beneath<SEP>I've seen the flash of teeth<SEP>Conspiring with the reef<SEP>To sink our ship<SEP>The wind's a cheating wife<SEP>Her tongue a thirsty knife<SEP>And she could take your life<SEP>With one good kiss<SEP>Can you see the sky turn red<SEP>As morning's light breaks over me?<SEP>Know tonight we'll make our bed<SEP>At the bottom of the sea<SEP>I know the ocean speaks (<SEP>The stars retreat behind their veil)<SEP>I've heard her call to me (<SEP>The clouds are clinging to your sail)<SEP>And smiling in my dreams (<SEP>The storm is coming, can you see?)<SEP>She whispers this:"<SEP>Can you see the sky turn red<SEP>As morning's light breaks over me?<SEP>Know tonight we'll make our bed<SEP>At the bottom of the sea"<SEP>Look and see the sky turn red<SEP>Like blood it covers over me<SEP>And soon the sea shall give up her dead<SEP>We'll raise an empire from the bottom of the sea.
