I hope I never give up.<SEP>So afraid I'll break the skin.<SEP>Do you feel the pain I own?<SEP>Can you see the pain I love?<SEP>Wrap my arms around my dreams.<SEP>Wake up to an empty room.<SEP>When will I have hope?<SEP>When will I have hope again for this world I hate?<SEP>With every ounce of flesh I will strangle self to a new way, new way of life.<SEP>Wrap my arms around this dream of apathy.<SEP>Strange lust of self conceived inveracities.<SEP>Never give in... never!
