As I walked out one evening<SEP>To breathe the air and soothe my mind,<SEP>I thought of friends and the home I had,<SEP>And all those things I left behind.<SEP>A silent star shone on me,<SEP>My eyes saw a far horizon,<SEP>As if to pierce this veil of time,<SEP>And escape this earthly prison.<SEP>Will there come a time when the memories fade.<SEP>And pass on with the long, long years,<SEP>When the ties no longer bind?<SEP>Lord save me from this darkest fear.<SEP>Don't let me come home a stranger,<SEP>I couldn't stand to be a stranger.
