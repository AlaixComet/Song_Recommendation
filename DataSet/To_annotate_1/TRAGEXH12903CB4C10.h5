Mama didn't always have those tears in her eyes And daddy once was able to hold his head up high But now I brought disgrace to my whole family Now they cry, but I'm not worth The tears they cry for me I loved a boy and then I found that he just lead me on So in my hurt and bitterness I let myself go alone But all I did was hurt myself And shame my family And now they cry but I'm not worth The tears they cry for me No I'm not worth The salt in one tiny tear Oh why have I brought shame To the one I loved so dear I'm so sorry that I hurt them But they'll never know how sorry And now they cry but I'm not worth The tears they cry for me Yes now they cry, but I'm not worth The tears they cry for me
