I decided on that evening that I was through with sitting still<SEP>I stood up and started moving with a childlike fascination<SEP>For those doors that don't have locks and the stairways that were blocked<SEP>So I dug through the obstruction, put my fist around the railing<SEP>And each step was far apart and far away from steps before it<SEP>And the air was getting thinner 'til I couldn't breathe at all<SEP>And if I happened to look behind me there were miles and miles of stairs<SEP>Enough so I couldn't see the doorway but I knew that it was there<SEP>And on the last step I was dizzy 'cause there were stairs in all directions<SEP>But I found another door and through the door there was the attic<SEP>Without old clothes, without a ceiling, everything had opened wide<SEP>Into the jaws of something bigger and suddenly I saw that I was<SEP>Upstairs and outside and<SEP>Freezing on the roof<SEP>Finally it had found me<SEP>The answer, the feeling and the truth<SEP>That I'm small<SEP>That I'm small<SEP>That I'm small<SEP>I'm smaller than the smallest fireball
