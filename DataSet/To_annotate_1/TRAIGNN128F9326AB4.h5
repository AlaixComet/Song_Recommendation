The end.<SEP>Destruction burns.<SEP>Fear pumps through the famous.<SEP>Desolation is in the air.<SEP>This is our station.<SEP>The weak, the corrupt. It dies.<SEP>Before our eyes it dies.<SEP>As far as the eye can see: only destruction.<SEP>Is it hopeless?<SEP>What can be done?<SEP>Is it too late?<SEP>Are we too late to save ourselves?<SEP>We're living in, in a dead world.<SEP>Crying out for a change.<SEP>What can be done?<SEP>Each day, we slip further away.<SEP>On the edge of ruin.<SEP>It won't be long before we succumb.<SEP>Is it hopeless?<SEP>What can be done?<SEP>Is it too late?<SEP>Are we too late to save ourselves?<SEP>We're living in, in a dead world.<SEP>It's so cold, and with no joy, we must save Ourselves.<SEP>Now this is a fight, because there is little left to hold on to.<SEP>And to beg forgiveness, for when in blackness, now I can see.<SEP>It's not too late, oh, not too late to save ourselves.<SEP>It's not too late, oh, not too late to save ourselves.
