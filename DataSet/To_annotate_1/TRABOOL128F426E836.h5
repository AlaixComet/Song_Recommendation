In darkness we do what we can<SEP>In daylight we're oblivion<SEP>Our hearts so raw and clear<SEP>Are turning away, turning away from here<SEP>On water we have walked like the fearless child<SEP>What was fastened we've unlocked revealing wondrous wild<SEP>And in search for confirmation<SEP>We have jumped into the fire<SEP>And scrambled with our burning feet through uncontrolled desire<SEP>There's a well upon the hill from our ancient past<SEP>Where an age is standing still holding strong and fast<SEP>And there's those that try to tame it<SEP>And the carve it into stone<SEP>Ah but words cannot extinguish it<SEP>However hard they're thrown<SEP>On Racherie they have worked with their island dreams<SEP>By Lough Cleggan they have nourished in the mountain streams<SEP>And in searching for acceptance<SEP>They have given it away<SEP>Only the children of our children<SEP>Know the price they had to pay
