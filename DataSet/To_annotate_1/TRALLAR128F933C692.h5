I've got a little girl, though I know it won't be long<SEP>Before she finds another boy who will sit her by the fireplace<SEP>And sing her a song<SEP>It feels like there's no safe place<SEP>In a world that's come apart<SEP>And the deafening sound of a bursting bubble<SEP>Wakes you up with a start<SEP>Is there nowhere that is safe<SEP>Why can't we change the rules so I win<SEP>All I need is an escape<SEP>A temporary place to hide<SEP>When she's coming in the door when she's walking out the door<SEP>Hard to tell which is worse<SEP>That false feeling of relief when she comes in<SEP>Or the empty feeling when she's gone<SEP>And every night on the streets the forces of darkness<SEP>Score another victory<SEP>And I stand with the timid waiting for the devil<SEP>To make a martyr of me<SEP>Fold up the tents and load up the trucks'<SEP>Cause it's time to move on<SEP>If we only knew where to go<SEP>I hope that we'd already be gone<SEP>And even when we're lying together, I make sure she falls asleep first<SEP>It seems when things are at their best, my mind starts to wander<SEP>To things at their worst<SEP>So do I fall asleep and dream of a peace that never will come<SEP>Or do I roll over and let her break the glass around my heart<SEP>And set off the alarm
