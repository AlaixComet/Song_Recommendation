Where, oh, where have you been, my love?<SEP>Where, oh, where can you be?<SEP>It's been so long since the moon has gone<SEP>And, oh, what a wreck you've made me<SEP>Are you there over the ocean?<SEP>Are you there up in the sky?<SEP>Until the return of my love<SEP>This lullaby<SEP>My hope is on the horizon<SEP>Every face, your eyes I can see<SEP>I plead and I pray through each night and day<SEP>Our embrace is only a dream<SEP>And as sure as days come from moments<SEP>Each hour becomes a life's time<SEP>When she'd left I'd only begun<SEP>This lullaby
