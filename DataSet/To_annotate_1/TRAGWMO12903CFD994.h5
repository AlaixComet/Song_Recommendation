Man's fall a cause for my hatred<SEP>It turns to rage and is repressed inside<SEP>To hide inside<SEP>To strike me blind with my anger stricken with rage<SEP>But in me a passion dwells to give all that I have<SEP>I can no longer hide this hate for the world<SEP>I can no longer hide this hate for what you have done<SEP>You take your broken path but never expect me to follow<SEP>I'll take your tired lies and shove them all back down your throat
