See the ruin on the hill<SEP>Where the smoke is hanging still<SEP>Like an echo of an age long forgotten.<SEP>There's a story of a home<SEP>Crushed beneath those blackened stones<SEP>And a roof that fell before the beams were rotten.<SEP>See, Saul Darby loved his wife<SEP>And he laboured all his life<SEP>To provide her with material possessions<SEP>And he built for her a home<SEP>Of the finest wood and stone<SEP>And the building soon became his sole obsession.<SEP>Oh it took three hundred days<SEP>For the timber to be raised<SEP>And the silhouette was seen for miles around<SEP>And the gables reached as high<SEP>As the eagles in the sky<SEP>But it only took one night to bring it down --<SEP>When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.<SEP>Though the shared a common bed<SEP>There was precious little said<SEP>In the moments that were set aside for sleeping.<SEP>For his busy dreams were filled<SEP>With the rooms he'd yet to build<SEP>And he never heard young Helen Darby weeping.<SEP>Then one night he heard a sound<SEP>As he laid his pencil down<SEP>And he traced it to her door and turned the handle,<SEP>And the pale light of the moon, Through the windows of the room,<SEP>Split the shadows where two bodies lay entangled.<SEP>Oh it took three hundred days<SEP>For the timber to be raised<SEP>And the silhouette was seen for miles around<SEP>And the gables reached as high<SEP>As the eagles in the sky<SEP>But it only took one night to bring it down --<SEP>When Darby's castle tumbled to the ground.
