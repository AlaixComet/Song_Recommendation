Remembering the night again So cold outside, the snow began That winter stone cold like a life Your eyes were wide enough to fill I was so bored, it should've spilled Chicago skyline lit the night Cut my nose, bite my face Tonight will last forever Take my life with your hands I laid with you until the end Watching the breathe crawl from your bones My alibi was lost that night So take your last breathe in tonight With the frozen sky, surround your eyes Chicago skyline lit the night Cut my nose, bite my face Tonight will last forever Take my life with your hands
