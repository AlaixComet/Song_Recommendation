There's a silence full of stars for as far as I can see<SEP>In the silence where you are do you ever dream of me<SEP>The moon is dark the night is silver wild perfume is on the breeze<SEP>I feel the stars cold as forever half as true as you and me<SEP>And I'll be your friend I'll be your lover I'll be whatever you ever need<SEP>Right to the end until it's over I swear to you you can count on me<SEP>But my heart is breaking here tonight my soul is weary from the fight<SEP>My God I've tried and I've been true my love I'm coming home to you(<SEP>Harmonica)<SEP>I'll be your friend...
