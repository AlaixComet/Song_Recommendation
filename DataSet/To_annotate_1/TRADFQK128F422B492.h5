I was in the safeway store when I saw you in aisle four<SEP>I swear you looked so nice, you were buying milk that was made out of rice<SEP>I tried to think of something clever to say but you were already walking away<SEP>In an attempt to get my groove on I offered you my white castle coupon<SEP>The radio was playing seal, I tried to tell you how I feel<SEP>But then our shopping carts locked wheels and the moment just seemed wrong<SEP>Oh, won't you do what's right, put your groceries in my car tonight<SEP>I want to take you home<SEP>Oh, with your eyes of blue I want to drink rice milk with you<SEP>I'll be your one and only, so we won't be so lonely
