City lights are flashing, they call you to the streets<SEP>Hearts are filled with passion in everyone you meet<SEP>The Boulevard is waiting, it wants to get you high<SEP>Neon signs are waiting to sell you anything you want to buy<SEP>But I know your devices, it shouldn't seem so odd<SEP>You lied from the beginning, I see through your facade<SEP>Angel of light, I see you glow in the night<SEP>But you only bring darkness to my soul<SEP>Angel of light, You're telling me wrong is right<SEP>I won't let you're evil take control<SEP>They follow in your footsteps not knowing that you fell<SEP>Bumper to bumper on the freeway to hell<SEP>You lead them into wrong and you make it look so right<SEP>You lead them into darkness and make them think you lead them into light<SEP>But I know where you're going, too bad you're not alone<SEP>If it wasn't for the real light I might have never known<SEP>Angel of light, I see you glow in the night<SEP>But you only bring darkness to my soul<SEP>Angel of light, You're telling me wrong is right<SEP>I won't let you're evil take control<SEP>You got the clergy working overtime to widen the narrow way<SEP>You've got politicians everywhere listening to what you say<SEP>You've got false apostles teaching lies perverting the only way<SEP>You've got principalities and powers waiting to obey<SEP>You've got philosophies and vain deceits lying to deceive<SEP>You've got hate, and greed, ungodly lusts in the deadly web you weave<SEP>Somehow you've got so many thinking you're not even there<SEP>One look is all it takes to get them blinded by your glare<SEP>Angel of light, I see you glow in the night<SEP>But you only bring darkness to my soul<SEP>Angel of light, You're telling me wrong is right<SEP>I won't let you're evil take control
