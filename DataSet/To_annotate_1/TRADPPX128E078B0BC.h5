It seems no matter how far I may roam<SEP>Like some old tumbleweed, my thoughts go tumblin' back home<SEP>In memories I recall those simpler times<SEP>And a way of life I never left behind<SEP>Down at the old corral<SEP>Just sittin', watchin' the sun go down<SEP>Oh, how I'm wishin' that I could be there now<SEP>Down at the old corral<SEP>I remember everything I ever heard<SEP>Like how to judge a man's true worth, by how he keeps his word<SEP>That saddle wisdom never seemed to end<SEP>Everything I need to know I learned back then<SEP>Down at the old corral<SEP>Just sittin', watchin' the sun go down<SEP>Oh, how I'm wishin' that I could be there now<SEP>Down at the old corral<SEP>Down at the old corral<SEP>Just sittin', watchin' the sun go down<SEP>Oh, how I'm wishin' that I could be there now<SEP>Down at the old corral<SEP>Down at the old corral<SEP>Down at the old corral
