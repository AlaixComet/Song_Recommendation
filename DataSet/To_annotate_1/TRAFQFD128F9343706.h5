Put me in a rocketship and send me straight to mars I'll bring you back a pocket full of stars shoot me through the ozone layer somewhere off the charts the world is theirs but the rest of it is ours dream with me the trip is always free take my hand and leave this world for awhile hop aboard my astral plane it should be quite a ride we'll buzz the eiffel tower and the English countryside into the sun I'll dip my wing and fly back four hundred years to give to you a sonnet penned by shakespeare dream with me the trip is always free take my hand and leave this world for awhile
