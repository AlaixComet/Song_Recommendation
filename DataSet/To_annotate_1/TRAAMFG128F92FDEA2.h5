Take a look in the mirror, look at yourself<SEP>But don't you look too close, cause you just might see the person<SEP>That you hate the most, Lord, what's happening to this human race<SEP>I can't even see one friendly face, brothers fight brothers and sisters wink their eyes<SEP>While silver tongues bear fruits of poison lies, take a look at your children<SEP>Born innocent, every boy and every girl, denying themselves a real chance<SEP>To build a better world, oh! Dear Lord what's happening to your precious dream<SEP>I think its washing away on a bloody, bloody stream, yes, take a look at your children<SEP>Before it's too late, and tell them nobody, nobody wins when the prize is hate<SEP>Oh, no, no, no It's not too late, we gotta tell all of our children<SEP>That love, love, love is the way, yeah, yeah
