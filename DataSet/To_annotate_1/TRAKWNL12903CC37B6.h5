I didn't want to feel like a slave to your mood swings<SEP>And I'm not saying anything I wouldn't say behind your back<SEP>And all this shit could have happened to anyone<SEP>All that matters now is how you're gonna pick it up to throw it back<SEP>It's so hard to get along<SEP>I always know what you're gonna say<SEP>This too. I hated you<SEP>I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut<SEP>I never meant to start anything that I couldn't finish<SEP>But now I've gotta be the one to turn away, it's time to react<SEP>I meant every word that I said, yeah I really did<SEP>But you gotta understand that I was sleeping then<SEP>So relax<SEP>I walked away, now remember me lover<SEP>I told you lies, now remember me lover<SEP>I took your money, remember me lover<SEP>I ruined your life, now remember me lover<SEP>It's so hard to get along<SEP>I always know what you're gonna say<SEP>This too. I hated you<SEP>I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut<SEP>I've been through this with you about a hundred times<SEP>Agree to disagree, and start again with our lives<SEP>Then every single morning I wake up and you're still there<SEP>But tomorrow you will be alone and that is all you deserve<SEP>I walked away, now remember me lover<SEP>I told you lies, now remember me lover<SEP>I took your money, remember me lover<SEP>I ruined your life, now remember me lover<SEP>It's so hard to get along<SEP>I always know what you're gonna say<SEP>This too. I hated you<SEP>I wish you'd learn to keep your mouth shut
