We live out here in the desert<SEP>Where time stands still in the face of our foolish pride<SEP>We trade our love for ambition<SEP>And tell each other we'll get it on back in time<SEP>But time moves on like a river<SEP>She leaves us all behind<SEP>Like a summer rain it all gets washed away<SEP>Round and round and round we go where it stops don't no one know<SEP>If you find a love you better let 'em know or you both get washed away<SEP>Round and round and round we go where it stops don't no one know<SEP>If you find a love you better hold on fast or you both get washed away<SEP>I watch the wind blow out there, maybe hear some distant laughter<SEP>Look outside the hotel window and my soul wanders off me<SEP>This is the time I'm mentioning and I won't soon forget that<SEP>Your proud beauty lingers on until the storm is lifted<SEP>Go find your fortune fast, its cold outside but you'll make it<SEP>Don't trade your love for ambition, or you'll get washed away<SEP>Love clich√© and you used to tell me some things better change all things won't last<SEP>Do the best you can, it'll all work out at the end of the storm you get to love another day<SEP>Round and round and round we go where it stops don't no one know<SEP>If you find a love you better hold on fast or you both get washed away<SEP>Round and round and round we go where it stops don't no one know<SEP>If you find a love you better let 'em know or you both get washed away<SEP>Round and round and round we go where it stops don't no one know<SEP>If you find a love you better hold on fast or you both get washed away<SEP>Round and round and round we go where it stops don't no one know<SEP>If you find a love you better hold on fast or you both get washed away<SEP>The time we spend as we pass this way, we might not ever be here again<SEP>Hold on tight, do what you might and then we got tomorrow
