Woke up in the middle of the night cold sweating<SEP>Ass stinging no breath legs clinging to the bedside<SEP>Hard pressed just to get a little rest every night<SEP>Same shit can't remember last time that I slept right<SEP>This situation's gotten out of control<SEP>With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload<SEP>My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go<SEP>The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul<SEP>Listen<SEP>Got burnt by women poor dirts? In Venice<SEP>Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors(<SEP>Joyo Verlade)<SEP>We have a deep passion<SEP>We can't keep dwelling on problems<SEP>Close relations past friendships don't last<SEP>No benefits plan, wrote a letter to my senator(<SEP>Joyo Verlade)<SEP>We have a deep passion<SEP>We can't keep dwelling on problems<SEP>This situation's gotten out of control (hey he hey)<SEP>With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload (hey he hey)<SEP>My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go (hey he hey)<SEP>The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul (hey he hey)<SEP>Singing<SEP>These bad dreams {*2<SEP>X*}<SEP>These bad dreams {*2<SEP>X*}<SEP>Shit now I lay me down to sleep<SEP>Please god let it end once again let me live life(<SEP>Joyo Verlade)<SEP>We have a deep passion<SEP>We can't keep dwelling on problems'<SEP>Cause I can't do another long dance with a ghost<SEP>See my head wanna come around half past midnight(<SEP>Joyo Verlade)<SEP>We have a deep passion<SEP>We can't keep dwelling on problems<SEP>This situation's gotten out of control (hey he hey)<SEP>With all this stress and confrontation I just might overload (hey he hey)<SEP>My problems follow me to sleep at night won't let me go (hey he hey)<SEP>The more I hide the more they thrive deep down inside of my soul (hey he hey)(<SEP>Joyo Verlade)<SEP>We have a deep passion<SEP>We can't keep dwelling on problems<SEP>These bad dreams
