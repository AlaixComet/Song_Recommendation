With the dawn Comes the loathing With the morning Comes the fall With the qualm Come the vermin Come to spawn From the sun they crawl With the night Dies the calm With revulsion Comes the spite With the light Come the lightmares Waking Moloch Comes with the fall Succumb Withdraw your soul from this fallacy This infamy is not for us With the night Comes deliverance Comes the spark That sets us alight With the dark Comes remembrance Comes the halo Comes the flight And the ground takes a fall Torn upon winds of witchery Resplendent wings unfold Revelling in lucid lechery We invoke what no eye can behold Azure, her gaping portal I blaze in ecstasy The goddess calls, immortal Shrugs off all treachery Stay down Wait for evenfall For the night to embrace us again Wait for evenfall Sleep now Wait for evenfall For the abyss will set us free Wait for evenfall
