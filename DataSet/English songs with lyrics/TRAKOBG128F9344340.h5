So long we've been married last burdens we've carried<SEP>Though fate kept us humble and made our love true<SEP>But plans that we made up someone seems to break up<SEP>Oh darling what else can we do<SEP>We may have to leave here to find piece of mind dear<SEP>Some place where we can live a life of our own<SEP>For I know you love me and happy we could be if some folks would leave us alone<SEP>When I go out walking there's lots of loose talking<SEP>They say we're unhappy and we'll break apart<SEP>But darling it's not true because I still love you and I do it all of my heart<SEP>We may have to leave here...<SEP>They say you are leaving that you are deceiving<SEP>But you tell me they say the same about me<SEP>But we'll show them there on that loose talk and do harm<SEP>And hope that's the truth they will see<SEP>We may have to leave here...
