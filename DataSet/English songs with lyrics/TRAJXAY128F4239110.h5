I don't know the words that I should say A symphony of letters set in place I only know That I love you I don't have a plane that I can fly Spelling out your name up in the sky I only know That I love you So tell me you love me Tell me that you feel the same Simple and true And better the old fashioned way I can't take you on a rocket to the moon Write a poem set in France to make you swoon I only know yeah That I love you Yes, I do So tell me you love me Tell me that you feel the same Simple and true And better the old fashioned way Even though a diamond shines like light Nothing on this earth could sparkle brighter than you I love you
