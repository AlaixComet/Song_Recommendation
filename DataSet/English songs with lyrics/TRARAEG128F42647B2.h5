The air is getting hotter<SEP>There's a rumbling in the skies<SEP>I've been wading through the high muddy water<SEP>With the heat rising in my eyes<SEP>Every day your memory grows dimmer<SEP>It doesn't haunt me like it did before<SEP>I've been walking through the middle of nowhere<SEP>Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door<SEP>When I was in Missouri<SEP>They would not let me be<SEP>I had to leave there in a hurry<SEP>I only saw what they let me see<SEP>You broke a heart that loved you<SEP>Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore<SEP>I've been walking that lonesome valley<SEP>Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door<SEP>People on the platforms<SEP>Waiting for the trains<SEP>I can hear their hearts a-beatin'<SEP>Like pendulums swinging on chains<SEP>When you think that you've lost everything<SEP>You find out you can always lose a little more<SEP>I'm just going down the road feeling bad<SEP>Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door<SEP>I'm going down the river<SEP>Down to New Orleans<SEP>They tell me everything is gonna be all right<SEP>But I don't know what "all right" even means<SEP>I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane<SEP>Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore<SEP>I been all around the world, boys<SEP>Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door<SEP>Gotta sleep down in the parlor<SEP>And relive my dreams<SEP>I'll close my eyes and I wonder<SEP>If everything is as hollow as it seems<SEP>Some trains don't pull no gamblers<SEP>No midnight ramblers, like they did before<SEP>I been to Sugartown, I shook the sugar down<SEP>Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door
