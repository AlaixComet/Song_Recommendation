The night sets softly with the hush of falling leaves<SEP>Casting shivering shadows on the houses through the trees<SEP>And the light from a street lamp paints a pattern on my wall<SEP>Like the pieces of a puzzle or a child's uneven scrawl<SEP>Up a narrow flight of stairs in a narrow little room<SEP>As I lie upon my bed in the early evening gloom<SEP>Impaled on my wall, my eyes can dimly see<SEP>The pattern of my life and the puzzle that is me<SEP>From the moment of my birth to the instant of my death<SEP>There are patterns I must follow just as I must breathe each breath<SEP>Like a rat in a maze, the path before me lies<SEP>And the pattern never alters until the rat dies<SEP>And the pattern still remains on the wall where darkness fell<SEP>And it's fitting that it should for in darkness I must dwell<SEP>Like the color of my skin or the day that I grow old<SEP>My life is made of patterns that can scarcely be controlled
