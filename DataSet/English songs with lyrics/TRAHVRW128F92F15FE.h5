How did it get so late, where did the night go to<SEP>Strange how it slips away when I'm with you<SEP>I know it's almost two, I know you should leave, but wait<SEP>I've thought it over and there's something I gotta say.<SEP>Why don't you spend the night? Somehow it seems so right<SEP>Why does it have to end so soon, please stay 'til the morning light<SEP>It's such a long way home, and you'd only be alone<SEP>Ah, come on now, why don't you spend the night?<SEP>Maybe I spoke too soon and maybe my timing's wrong<SEP>Or maybe it's something I shouldn't have said at all<SEP>But when I look in your eyes, I feel like we're almost one<SEP>Ah, something tells me the night's only just begun.<SEP>Why don't you spend the night? Somehow it seems so right<SEP>Why does it have to end so soon, please stay 'til the morning light<SEP>It's such a long way home, and you'd only be alone<SEP>Ah, come on now, why don't you spend the night?<SEP>Why don't you spend the night? Somehow it seems so right<SEP>Why does it have to end so soon, please stay 'til the morning light<SEP>It's such a long way home, and you'd only be alone<SEP>Ah, come on now, why don't you spend the night?...
