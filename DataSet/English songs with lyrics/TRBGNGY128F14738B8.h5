Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne<SEP>That's where live's my cajun baby the fairest one in the land<SEP>Her teeth're white and pearly hair black as coal<SEP>Wouldn't trade my cajun baby for the world's gold<SEP>Way down yonder in the bayou country in dear old Louisianne<SEP>My heart's been sad and lonely since the day I left her side<SEP>But today I got her letter said she'd be my cajun bride<SEP>Gonna go and wed my cajun baby and I've by the old bayou<SEP>Eat a lotsa shrimp and crawfish ride around in my old pirogue<SEP>Before the sun goes down this evening I'll be on my way<SEP>To see my cajun baby and there I'm gonna stay<SEP>On a Saturday night we go dancin' and listen to the fiddle-o<SEP>Lord I got me a cajun baby just a livin' and a lovin' by the old bayou
