Of all the wars you've fought,<SEP>Which one is etched along your headstone,<SEP>Bygone, remote, and cast aside?<SEP>Did you hold it in your hands every single night?<SEP>Did you wash them in the waters of a grave?<SEP>Silence in sovereign fleet the hand that dare seize the fire.<SEP>Struggle to sound above the piercing,<SEP>Echo trill of this hapless, bloody sigh.<SEP>Stalking in this fearful symmetry the trail back,<SEP>To the hammer, the chain, and the furnace.<SEP>Slowly they will tarnish and break.<SEP>The tiger utters not his own name.<SEP>And in triumph, and in glory,<SEP>Our earth is blackened. In solace do we sing.<SEP>I'm not ashamed.<SEP>If blood is what you ask,<SEP>Then I have nothing to offer.<SEP>Your ghost is leaving; it has undone itself.<SEP>In death they do speak low into our ears,"<SEP>I've been waiting for this,"<SEP>Unchanging.
