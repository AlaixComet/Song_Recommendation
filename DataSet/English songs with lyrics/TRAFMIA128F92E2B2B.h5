I was sitting in my room, dark and gray and crying<SEP>Someone in my life I fear was at the point of dying<SEP>A cold wind blew right up my spine, it was the break of dawn<SEP>A little voice way deep inside told me she was gone<SEP>Oh... This house is haunted<SEP>Oh... That's how I want it to be<SEP>Oh... This house is haunted<SEP>You can always stay here with me...<SEP>No more singing, no more laughing, no more sunny days<SEP>She left and took the colours with her, buried in her grave<SEP>This is where we climbed the tower, this is where she fell<SEP>Then when her young heart stopped beating, I went to hell<SEP>Oh... This house is haunted<SEP>Oh... Ha...<SEP>Oh... This house is haunted<SEP>Ho... Oh...<SEP>You float through the living room, I watch my T<SEP>VI feel you sit down on the couch right here next to me<SEP>The I feel you lips touch mine just like we used to do<SEP>I'm so happy all alone being here with you...
