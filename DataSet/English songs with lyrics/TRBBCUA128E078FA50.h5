Brushfire fairytales Itsy bitsy diamond wells Big fat hurricanes Yellow bellied given names Well shortcuts can slow you down And in the end we're bound To rebound off of we Well dust off your thinking caps Solar powered plastic plants Pretty pictures of things we ate We are only what we hate But in the long run we have found Silent films are full of sound Inaudibly free<SEP>Slow down everyone You're moving too fast Frames can't catch you when You're moving like that Inaudible melodies Serve narrational strategies Unobtrusive tones<SEP>Help to notice nothing but the zone Of visual relevancy Frame-lines tell me what to see Chopping like an axe<SEP>Or maybe Eisenstein should just relax Slow down everyone You're moving too fast Frames can't catch you when You're moving like that Well Plato's cave is full of freaks Demanding refunds for the things they've seen I wish they could believe<SEP>In all the things that never made the screen<SEP>And just slow down everyone<SEP>You're moving too fast Frames can't catch you when You're moving like that Slow down everyone You're moving too fast Frames can't catch you when you're moving like that<SEP>Moving too fast
