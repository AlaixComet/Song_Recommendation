You stupid sheep open your eyes, He's not a lamb but a<SEP>Wolf in disguise. He'll lead you all to the edge of<SEP>The hill, He will say "jump"and I know you all will.<SEP>You follow blindly till the end of the line, You look<SEP>Around and there's nothing but swine. You trust his<SEP>Lies 'cause they're easy to hear, You gave all your<SEP>Faith now your faith disappeared. Frontal Lobotomy.<SEP>Invent your god; put your faith in the sky, But you're<SEP>Sill worried if you're trusting a lie. You pray so<SEP>Hard and you claim he talks back, But I hear voices<SEP>Too after I smoke some crack. Hypocrisy - the way of<SEP>The man, Away from the truth is the way that you ran.<SEP>The holy priest engaging in sodomy, To find truth have<SEP>A frontal lobotomy. Frontal Lobotomy.
