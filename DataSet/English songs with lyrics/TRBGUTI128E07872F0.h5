When you grow up in my hood, help don't show up in my hood, gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood. Feel like I'm trapped in my hood, young kids get clapped in my hood, that's why I'm strapped in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood<SEP>In my hood<SEP>In my hood<SEP>In my hood<SEP>I'm always close to, feeling like a corner stander stoop to sit on, hallway post up. No matter where I go it's always post up, feels just like it I<SEP>N M<SEP>Y H<SEP>OO<SEP>D, cops drive in it every 5 minutes. Look at your faces pat your waistes, try to find a stash where the gats and base is, I can't say that they racist. But I know it ain't the same in they town and as fucked up as it may sound I<SEP>N M<SEP>Y H<SEP>OO<SEP>D, there's two ways to make it happen off the streets, balling on the courts or rapping off the beats. You hear the shells tapping off the crete and they clapping off the heat then the yellow tapes trapping off the street. But that's the way we were raised praying to god hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays.<SEP>When you grow up in my hood, help don't show up in my hood, gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood. Feel like I'm trapped in my hood, young kids get clapped in my hood, that's why I'm strapped in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood<SEP>In my hood<SEP>In my hood<SEP>In my hood<SEP>They drink till the cups dry, eat till the plates clean, niggas be in state greens before they turn 18, round here you never let the beat slide twice, everybody raised on four wings and beef fried rice. The mothers are getting younger today, got one in the hand, one in the stroller and one on the way. We don't have role models but we got those hand guns that hold hollows I<SEP>N M<SEP>Y H<SEP>OO<SEP>D. Ain't no diploams or degrees, but you can get high from the aroma of the trees I<SEP>N M<SEP>Y H<SEP>OO<SEP>D. I know it like navigation and fuck having patience, I'm gonna get mine you better get yours, cause every day is a struggle and one time ride through everyday just to bug you. That's how it is cause your rights be wrong and everybody got a white T on when you in my hood.<SEP>When you grow up in my hood, help don't show up in my hood, gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood. Feel like I'm trapped in my hood, young kids get clapped in my hood, that's why I'm strapped in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood<SEP>In my hood<SEP>In my hood<SEP>In my hood<SEP>We try to make the most of what we got, you either been hit of been close to getting shot I<SEP>N M<SEP>Y H<SEP>OO<SEP>D, any nigga who pulls be getting got and dope heads fiend to get a dose of what we got. Young niggas be like they slow but you give them a blunt, bet they roll the weed like a pro, if you a chick it nots a problem to get you laid, but if you stick without a condom it'll get you aids. No sesame street kids, watch B<SEP>ET, look up to niggas that ain't got a G.<SEP>E.<SEP>D, I know a dude with the deadbeat tag, kids don't got diapers but hes riding in the red g wag. In the hood you and your hoods is sure to bump heads and everybody grew up sleeping on a bunk bed there telling me to vote... and I would if it make a change in my hood. Motherfucker.<SEP>When you grow up in my hood, help don't show up in my hood, gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood. Feel like I'm trapped in my hood, young kids get clapped in my hood, that's why I'm strapped in my hood, just 'cause you in my hood<SEP>In my hood<SEP>In my hood<SEP>In my hood
