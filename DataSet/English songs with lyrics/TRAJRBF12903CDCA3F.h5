Thread the needle, for this cut is deep.<SEP>You can wipe the blood away, but it still stains our skin.<SEP>Nothing lost other than a fragment of strength, but we will reside.<SEP>Over and over again we took this verbal homicidal attack.<SEP>Look in our eyes.<SEP>Look at what we've become.<SEP>You did nothing to make us.<SEP>These screams still echo and the scars remain, but we wil hold on, together.<SEP>Emotions settle, sorrow fades, but the thought of you will elapse.
