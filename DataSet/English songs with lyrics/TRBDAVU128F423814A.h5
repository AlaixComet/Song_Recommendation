It might be hard to be lovers<SEP>But it's harder to be friends<SEP>Baby pull down the covers<SEP>It's time you let me in<SEP>Maybe light a couple candles<SEP>I'll just go ahead and lock the door<SEP>If you'll just talk to me baby<SEP>Till we ain't strangers anymore<SEP>Lay your head on my pillow<SEP>I'll sit beside you on the bed<SEP>Don't you think it's time to say<SEP>Some things we haven't said<SEP>It ain't too late to get back to that place<SEP>Back to the way, we thought it was before<SEP>Why don't you look at me<SEP>Till we ain't strangers anymore<SEP>Sometimes it's hard to love me<SEP>Sometimes it's hard to love you too<SEP>I know it's hard believing<SEP>That love can pull us through<SEP>It would be so easy to live your life<SEP>With one foot out the door<SEP>Just hold me baby<SEP>Till we ain't strangers anymore<SEP>It's hard to find forgiveness<SEP>When we just turn out the lights<SEP>It's hard to say you're sorry<SEP>When we can't tell wrong from right<SEP>It would be so easy to spend your whole damn life<SEP>Just keeping score<SEP>So let's get down to it baby<SEP>There ain't no need to lie<SEP>Tell me who you think you see<SEP>When you look into my eyes<SEP>Let's put our two hearts back together<SEP>And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor<SEP>Make love with me baby<SEP>Till we ain't strangers anymore<SEP>We're not strangers anymore
