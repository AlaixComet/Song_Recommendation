Everyday in lunch in high school,<SEP>And all of my senior year,<SEP>I'd drink my Coca-<SEP>Cola with a touch of everclear.<SEP>I never had to study math, science or history,<SEP>I'd have a chemical flashback to jog my memory.<SEP>In my junior year I swore I loved sweet Miss Sherrie-<SEP>Ann,<SEP>One night I put some everclear in her Dr. Pepper can.<SEP>I thought it'd make her easy, but she took it pretty hard,<SEP>I took her home and rang her doorbell, left her lyin' in the yard.<SEP>Tequila dries me out, and beer just makes me fat.<SEP>Whiskey makes me nauseous, tell me who the hell needs that?<SEP>If you're thinkin' about drinkin', then the answer's crystal clear,<SEP>It's the invisible intoxicant... its called everclear.<SEP>I remember my church picnic in the spring of '89,<SEP>They had 4 fresh watermelon sliced right off the vine.<SEP>When they bowed their heads giving grace for the food,<SEP>Hey, I pulled out the bottle, and I soaked them melons good.<SEP>Well they never knew what hit 'em, when the potion went to work,<SEP>They had Grandma's doin' backflips, Grandpa's lookin' up their skirts.<SEP>They were singing Hallelujah and Willie Nelson songs,<SEP>Preacher said it was the best dang picnic,<SEP>That the baptists had ever thrown.<SEP>Tequila dries me out, and beer just makes me fat.<SEP>Whiskey makes me nauseous, tell me who the hell needs that?<SEP>If you're thinkin' about drinkin', then the answer's crystal clear,<SEP>It's the invisible intoxicant... its called everclear.<SEP>When I'm drinkin' everclear, I think I'm king of this whole world,<SEP>I'm bigger and badder than John Wayne and cooler than Steve Earle.<SEP>Until I wake up and I'm face down in the hall,<SEP>Hey, I'm completely naked, for a reason I can't recall.<SEP>Well I'm kinda, sorta thinkin' that maybe I met a chick,'<SEP>Cause there's perfume in the air, and there's lipstick on my neck.<SEP>Well I hope that she was pretty and I hope that she was kind,<SEP>Enough to leave my clothes somewhere they're easy to find.<SEP>Tequila dries me out, and beer just makes me fat.<SEP>Whiskey makes me nauseous; tell me who the hell needs that?<SEP>If you're thinkin' about drinkin', then the answer's crystal clear,<SEP>It's the invisible intoxicant... its called everclear.
