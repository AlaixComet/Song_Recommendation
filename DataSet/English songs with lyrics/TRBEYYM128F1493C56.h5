Children sleeping<SEP>Snow is softly falling.<SEP>Dreams are calling<SEP>Like bells in the distance.<SEP>We were dreamers not so long ago.<SEP>But one by one we all had to grow up.<SEP>When it seems the magic slipped away,<SEP>We find it all again on Christmas day...<SEP>Believe in what your heart is saying,<SEP>Hear the melody that's playing.<SEP>There's no time to waste,<SEP>There's so much to celebrate.<SEP>Believe in what you feel inside,<SEP>And give your dreams the wings to fly.<SEP>You have everything you need,<SEP>If you just believe.<SEP>Trains move quickly to their journey's end.<SEP>Destinations are where we begin again.<SEP>Ships go sailing far across the sea.<SEP>Trusting starlight, to get where they need to be.<SEP>When it seems that we have lost our way,<SEP>We find ourselves again on Christmas day...<SEP>Believe in what your heart is saying,<SEP>Hear the melody that's playing.<SEP>There's no time to waste,<SEP>There's so much to celebrate.<SEP>Believe in what you feel inside,<SEP>And give your dreams the wings to fly.<SEP>You have everything you need,<SEP>If you just believe.<SEP>If you just believe.<SEP>If you just believe.<SEP>If you just believe.<SEP>Just believe.<SEP>Just believe.
