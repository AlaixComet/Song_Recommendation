We were one - twin stars But haughtiness turned out as a stumbling block We were one - two burning souls But haughtiness brought us the downfall Woven tunes can wake the souls Of the sleeping ones Woven tunes can change this world And heal the deepest wounds We were one - twin stars But haughtiness turned out as a stumbling block True life is much more different And souls are weak Self-righteous - puerile dreams We couldn't save anyone
