How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable?<SEP>So condescending, unnecessarily critical<SEP>I have the tendency of getting very physical<SEP>So watch your step, 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle<SEP>You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here<SEP>This double vision I was seein' is finally clear<SEP>You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone<SEP>Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walkin' on<SEP>When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love<SEP>You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up (<SEP>Yeah, yeah, yeah)<SEP>And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams<SEP>Is there anyone out there?'<SEP>Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe<SEP>Is there anyone out there?'<SEP>Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe<SEP>What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head<SEP>You should know better, you never listened to a word I said<SEP>Clutchin' your pillow and writhin' in a naked sweat<SEP>Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did<SEP>And when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love<SEP>You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up (<SEP>Yeah, yeah, yeah)<SEP>And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams<SEP>Say, is there anyone out there?'<SEP>Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe<SEP>Is there anyone out there?'<SEP>Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe<SEP>Does it kill? Does it burn?<SEP>Is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control?<SEP>Does it thrill? Does it sting?<SEP>When you feel what I bring and you wish that you had me to hold<SEP>When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love<SEP>You'll understand what I mean when I say there's no way we're gonna give up (<SEP>Yeah, yeah, yeah)<SEP>And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams<SEP>Say, is there anyone out there?'<SEP>Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe<SEP>Is there anyone out there?'<SEP>Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe<SEP>Is there anyone out there?'<SEP>Cause it's gettin' harder and harder to breathe
