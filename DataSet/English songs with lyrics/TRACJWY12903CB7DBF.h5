I was just a young man<SEP>Working steady in a good time band<SEP>Pickin' every single little lick I could<SEP>Just to please the man<SEP>Harlan sang the lead for half<SEP>And we split up the rest<SEP>Hangin' on through the heavy times<SEP>And hopin' for the best<SEP>And I can't recall the names of all<SEP>Them places that we played in<SEP>All them squirrely party girls<SEP>And pills we used to pop<SEP>Hardly ever sleepin' in<SEP>Those cheap motels we stayed in<SEP>Hopin' we could take it till we'd make it to the top<SEP>And them nights, get a little bit brighter<SEP>And them bars just a little bit better<SEP>And the sweet, just a little bit sweeter<SEP>But them blues, well it's still the same old song<SEP>Now we're stars and shining on<SEP>Them prime time T<SEP>V shows<SEP>Every stranger knows our name<SEP>And every little where we go<SEP>Findin' out the bottom ain't so different><SEP>From the top<SEP>Just a few more friends that you'll be losin'<SEP>When you drop<SEP>And I've left some of my soul on<SEP>Every sweaty sheet that I could sleep on<SEP>Gettin' just as close to any body as I could<SEP>I don't regret a single bed I've laid my body down on<SEP>Ever since the first I had<SEP>The worst I had was good<SEP>And them nights, get a little bit brighter<SEP>And them bars just a little bit better<SEP>And the sweet, just a little bit sweeter<SEP>But them blues, well it's still the same old song
