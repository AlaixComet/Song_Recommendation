God damn, holy diver. You made it right back to my bed. Manifested lips that whisper kiss.<SEP>That whisper kiss. Hey, hey, hey. Pull the shades. I'm gutted. Guilty, played. And lonely.<SEP>I admit you won't see me again. My end is desperately engaged. Dark, departed, hollow.<SEP>You see I'm just a shadow. This ravenous beast is chasing shame. A shadow he remains.<SEP>How will my voice carry tonight? How do I look under these lights? Shove my head into the grand ivory keys.<SEP>Maybe this will teach me how to sing. Fuck hope, I'm a terror. Heavyweight human disaster.<SEP>I think I found Love. but what's love? When we can't be loved? Burn, burn, burn it down.<SEP>Icarus just hit the ground. To the youth that thought they could fly. I bottled up just drank up and died.<SEP>Palest white. I'm blues and reds. This patriot is long past dead. Forever ending. Remain but still gone.<SEP>Oh god I fear the steel. Oh how I fear the steel. Burn. My end is desperately engaged.
