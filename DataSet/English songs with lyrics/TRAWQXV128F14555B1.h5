Sky fell down and pulled us in<SEP>Stole away my oxygen<SEP>And left me standin' breathless there with you<SEP>The ocean wrapped around the sun<SEP>The smell of June - the taste of your tongue<SEP>Was all I'd ever need<SEP>I - well I wanna be clear<SEP>Well I needed you here<SEP>And I'm waiting you out<SEP>But you - you don't have a clue<SEP>And I'd drive right through<SEP>To find you anywhere<SEP>Sky fell down and pulled us in<SEP>Stole away my oxygen<SEP>And left me standin' breathless there with you<SEP>The ocean wrapped around the sun<SEP>The smell of June - the taste of your tongue<SEP>Was all I'd ever need<SEP>But you - you keep on waiting<SEP>For the sun to come around<SEP>And you - you keep on waiting<SEP>For something better - better off to come around<SEP>You - well you wanted more time<SEP>So I gave you more time<SEP>Oh but I am the sun that waits to come around<SEP>Oh but you were a restless soul<SEP>Where's the next best thing<SEP>While I waited for you<SEP>All my life waited for you to come around<SEP>Come around<SEP>Come around - come around<SEP>You're better off to come around<SEP>Come around - come around
