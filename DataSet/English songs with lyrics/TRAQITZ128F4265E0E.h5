On the park bench I slept on<SEP>Raindrops are fallin' on the newspapers coverin' me<SEP>I hear early mornin' motors<SEP>And I know the world is wakin' for the dawn<SEP>But my mind's down a dark alley<SEP>Somewhere where last night you loved me<SEP>And in the early mornin' chill my arms remember still<SEP>But I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone<SEP>The sun is roughly risin' on the roofs of Stagger town<SEP>The time for sweat and poison out is just now comin' 'round<SEP>The high time of last midnight is over with and gone<SEP>Leavin' me to be lonesome to the bone<SEP>I walked away the wind blows<SEP>And any way the wind goes will be good enough for me<SEP>The streets are loud and crowded<SEP>But I walk my weary way lost and alone<SEP>Your hot breath and your laughter<SEP>Keep flashin' through my mind to warm me<SEP>But the naked light of day soon makes it fade away<SEP>And I'm droppin' like a stone lonesome to the bone<SEP>The sun is roughly risin' on the roofs of Stagger town<SEP>The time for sweat and poison out is just now comin' 'round<SEP>The high time of last midnight is over with and gone<SEP>Leavin' me to be lonesome to the bone
