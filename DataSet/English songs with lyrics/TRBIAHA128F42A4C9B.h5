This is not a love song This is not a love song This is not a love song This is not a love song This is not a love song This is not a love song This is not a love song Happy to have, not to have not Big business is very wise I'm crossing over into E-enter-prize Love song Love song Love song Love song I'm going over to the other side I'm happy to have not to have not Big business is very wise I'm inside free enterprise I'm adaptable I'm adaptable I'm adaptable and I like my new role I'm getting better and better And I have a new goal I'm changing my ways where money applies This is not a love song This is not a love song This is not a love song This is not a love song This is not a love song Now are you ready to grab the candle That tunnel vision - not television Behind the curtain - out of the cupboard You take the first train - into the big world Now will I find you - now will you be there Not a love song<SEP>Not a love song Not a love song ...
