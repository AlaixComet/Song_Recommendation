Cold today, she's gone for the moment. I don't know which way she was goin'.<SEP>Lord, it's been a long, warm November. I know now, she acts like her mother.<SEP>I been holdin' on here forever, and I don't know where she's goin',<SEP>But hopefully, she knows not to come back now.<SEP>Kick in the door, get on the floor, went on one month cryin' woo hoo.<SEP>Somethin', the kiss. One night away, when I'm thinking bout that woo hoo.<SEP>Baby, you know that I could hold it on when I'm feelin' woo hoo.<SEP>Baby, you know that I could just sail away.<SEP>Gone away, so gone in the moment. Still couldn't tell which way she was goin'.<SEP>Shapin up and growin' right on me, and takin' my advice like a father.<SEP>I been holdin' on here forever, and I don't know where she's goin',<SEP>But hopefully she knows not to turn around.<SEP>Kick in the door, get on the floor, went on one month cryin' woo hoo.<SEP>Somethin', the kiss. One night away, when I'm thinking bout that woo hoo.<SEP>Baby, you know that I could hold it on when I'm feelin' woo hoo.<SEP>Baby, you know that I could just sail away.
