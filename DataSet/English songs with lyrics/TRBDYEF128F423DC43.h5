You never cry like a lover should Sigh when it feels real good Or see the sky through the stone and wood You never cry like a lover I thought I saw somebody I loved Sleeping deep inside you If I could catch you in an unguarded moment I'd stay right here beside you You never smile at me late at night Laugh out loud when we get it right You can't get loose if there's too much light You never smile like a lover I can't live with you baby, can't live without it And sometimes I believe in love Sometimes I doubt it But your life goes on Like a broken down carousel Where somebody left the music on You never move like you used to do Pour it out when you're feelin' blue Somebody must have put some pain on you You never cry like a lover (<SEP>You never Cry Like a Lover) Cry (<SEP>You never cry like a lover) You never cry (<SEP>Cry like a lover) Come on and cry (<SEP>You never cry like a lover
