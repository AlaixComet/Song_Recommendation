Standing on the corner of civilization<SEP>There's a time, there's a place for me<SEP>In a world where I can't be found<SEP>Cold and mean people give me the creeps<SEP>Going to the jungle where the elephant roams<SEP>Got to get away, gonna make it my home<SEP>Losing my taste for the human race<SEP>Social grace is a waste of time<SEP>It's absurd when I look around<SEP>So sublime that we blow my mind<SEP>Naked in the rain with a killer whale<SEP>I can't taste the salt when I lick his tail<SEP>Naked in the rain<SEP>Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?<SEP>Give it to me doctor, don't keep it<SEP>I never met an animal that I didn't like<SEP>You can come to me, I won't bite<SEP>Don't you know dog is man's best friend?<SEP>There is some love that you can't fight<SEP>Naked in the rain with black tattoos<SEP>Running through the woods, laughing at the blues<SEP>Naked in the rain<SEP>Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?<SEP>Give it to me doctor, don't keep it<SEP>Listen to the talking heart in my chest<SEP>With this gift, good Lord, I am blessed<SEP>There's a lump and it's in my throat<SEP>I'm in love with the wilderness<SEP>Naked in the river, skinny dipping my way<SEP>In the waterfall, I just wanna play<SEP>Naked in the rain<SEP>Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?<SEP>Give it to me doctor, don't keep it<SEP>Naked in the rain<SEP>Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?<SEP>Give it to me doctor, don't keep it
