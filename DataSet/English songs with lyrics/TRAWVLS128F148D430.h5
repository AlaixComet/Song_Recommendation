Chorus: *sung hook from an R&<SEP>B record*<SEP>Got to give the people<SEP>Give the people what they want<SEP>Ladies and Gentlemen<SEP>Verse One: Erick Sermon<SEP>When I came out with my first rap jam<SEP>I had no idea that the record would slam<SEP>It did real good without radio play<SEP>Maybe at night but no airplay in the day<SEP>I couldn't understand why to be exact<SEP>Our music was good and I was far from wack<SEP>Then came the answer, commercial was the key<SEP>To get airplay and a spot on T<SEP>VLike Ed Lover and Doctor Dre from Yo! M<SEP>TV Raps<SEP>A show, mainly for the black<SEP>And still we can't ill, cause to them that's wrong<SEP>Cause like P.<SEP>E. said, we're too black and too strong<SEP>But hey, what can I say(<SEP>Brothers and sisters) that's a price a rapper must pay<SEP>Verse Two: P<SEP>MD<SEP>As airwaves collapse rap shows at a standstill<SEP>Some racial circuits the frequencies can't handle<SEP>The funk tracks produced by E<SEP>PM<SEP>DBut it's a fat jam, that will never win a grammy<SEP>Unless we sellout and kill the black movement dead<SEP>Which means swallow our pride and become flunkies instead<SEP>And stop the rap about freedom, thoughts of a black president<SEP>And rap about a black crack, the mayor in our residence<SEP>Give me a break brothers, it's time to take a stand<SEP>And kill that no sir, yes sir, and thank you ma'am'<SEP>Cause the word is a luxury a black man can't afford<SEP>That's why poverty's on the rise and we still ignored<SEP>And it's a setback and yet the clock still ticks<SEP>And if we let it, rap would be run by politics<SEP>I read it somewhere that every man's created equal<SEP>But not in this day and age, maybe in the sequel<SEP>Which means next time, so observe these rhymes<SEP>And take a stand and go for yours 'cause I'm going for mine<SEP>That's why I<SEP>Verse Three: Erick Sermon, P<SEP>MD<SEP>Why is that when wrong is done by the black<SEP>It's blown out of proportion and immediately attacked<SEP>By the press and yes, conflict is caused<SEP>By the kids at concerts who bumrush the doors<SEP>One child gets hurt, the press gets pesty<SEP>But what about the Beatles, G, and Elvis Presley<SEP>Same stuff was rough, rap does not cause violence<SEP>So (<SEP>Fight the Power) and make them understand<SEP>But too much power and you might get banned<SEP>So if you want airplay<SEP>You can't be too black and hey, watch what you say, but ayo<SEP>Chorus: to fade
