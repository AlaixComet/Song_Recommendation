Old friends, old friends<SEP>Sat on their park bench like bookends<SEP>A newspaper blown through the grass<SEP>Falls on the round toes<SEP>Of the high shoes of the old friends<SEP>Old friends, winter companions, the old men<SEP>Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset<SEP>The sounds of the city sifting through trees<SEP>Settle like dust on the shoulders of the old friends<SEP>Can you imagine us years from today<SEP>Sharing a park bench quietly?<SEP>How terribly strange to be 70<SEP>Old friends, memory brushes the same years<SEP>Silently sharing the same fears
