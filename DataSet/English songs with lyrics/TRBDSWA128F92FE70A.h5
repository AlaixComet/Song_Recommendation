On one hand I count the reasons, I could stay with you<SEP>And hold you close to me, all night long<SEP>So many lover's games, I'd love to play with you<SEP>On that hand there's no reason, why it's wrong<SEP>But on the other hand, there's a golden band<SEP>To remind of someone, who would not understand<SEP>On one hand I could stay, and be your lovin' man<SEP>But the reason I must go, is on the other hand<SEP>In your arms I feel the passion, I thought had died<SEP>When I looked into your eyes, I found myself<SEP>And when I first kissed your lips, I felt so alive<SEP>I've got to hand it to you girl, you're somethin' else<SEP>But on the other hand, there's a golden band<SEP>To remind of someone, who would not understand<SEP>On one hand I could stay, and be your lovin' man<SEP>But the reason I must go, is on the other hand<SEP>Yeah the reason I must go, is on the other hand
