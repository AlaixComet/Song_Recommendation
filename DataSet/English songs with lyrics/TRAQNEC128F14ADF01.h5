Another day in Nigeria the children beg for bread,<SEP>The crops failed, the well ran dry<SEP>When they lost the watershed<SEP>A baby dies, its mother cries, the children gather 'round<SEP>They're wondering what the day will bring<SEP>Will they be the next one found?<SEP>Do you dare to gaze into their hollow eyes, hollow eyes?<SEP>Are they staring holes in you with their hollow eyes,<SEP>Hollow eyes, hollow eyes?<SEP>In the crowded sheds the children lay their heads<SEP>To escape the Haitian heat<SEP>The hunger pains drive them to the street<SEP>Wond'ring if today they'll eat<SEP>Some find food in the refuse heap, others find disease<SEP>Some find it harder just to live when they can die with ease.<SEP>The least of these is hungry.<SEP>The least of these is sick.<SEP>The least of these needs clothing.<SEP>The least of these needs drink.<SEP>The least of these knows sorrow.<SEP>The least of these knows grief.<SEP>The least of these has suffered pain, and Jesus is His name.(2nd Chorus)<SEP>Do you dare to gaze into His hollow eyes, hollow eyes?<SEP>Is He staring back at you with His hollow eyes,<SEP>Hollow eyes, hollow eyes?
