Move! Move! Move!<SEP>Go! Go! Go! Go!<SEP>The world can't slow us down<SEP>You can't kill what will not die<SEP>Go!<SEP>Wingspans spread to keep<SEP>The world within reach<SEP>A promise to myself sealed with anguish<SEP>That no matter how hard I fall,<SEP>I will always stand up stronger<SEP>Harder-a bigger man unleashing pain<SEP>There's nothing between us<SEP>You think you know,<SEP>But you have no idea<SEP>The horrors that I've seen<SEP>I'll scratch out my eyes<SEP>To close the gates to my inner soul<SEP>Break from this ball and chain<SEP>Society and the heretics<SEP>The world can't slow us down<SEP>You can't kill what will not die<SEP>You don't give back<SEP>You mean nothing to this world
