Take me back in time<SEP>To the day I was your valentine<SEP>No halo over your head<SEP>We stayed at home and spent the day in bed<SEP>Your skin so hot to the touch<SEP>I never wanted anyone so much<SEP>You're a sight for sore eyes to see<SEP>Won't somebody come and rescue me<SEP>I've spent along time away<SEP>And it's good to be home<SEP>And together is better than being alone<SEP>It's a far cry from anything I've ever felt like before<SEP>Yes and long is the road<SEP>That's been leading me back to your door<SEP>A daydream out of the blue<SEP>Into something so sad but true<SEP>An old friend back from the dead<SEP>To steal the covers sleeping in your bed<SEP>I never meant to be an aggravation<SEP>I'm only looking for a second chance<SEP>I'm so hard-headed that determination<SEP>Left me all alone<SEP>That's why I'm coming home<SEP>Running all the way
