Can you live without one red cent?<SEP>Can a little true heart really pay the rent?<SEP>No, it'll take a lot of give to get<SEP>All the money you've spent it's a game of pressure<SEP>So put a little on the back of someone else'<SEP>Cause another problem just to ease yourself<SEP>Can't you see that it's coming back around, and when it comes back<SEP>It'll drive you farther down<SEP>It'll drive you farther down...<SEP>Free-how are you?<SEP>Is it life that holds us down?<SEP>Free-now are you?<SEP>When I'm stuck here on the ground<SEP>Can you fly without your wings on board?<SEP>It seems pretty unfair to end up on the floor<SEP>Paying for a crime you weren't charged for<SEP>Alive in a world that always wants more<SEP>Is it any wonder that you're falling back<SEP>Inside the pattern that defines all you lack?<SEP>Don't you want to get into your car and get out of this town?<SEP>Get out of this town?<SEP>When I'm stuck here on the ground<SEP>It's all about the wrong thing<SEP>If doesn't make your heart sing<SEP>It couldn't be the right place<SEP>With those tears upon your face<SEP>Free-now are you?
