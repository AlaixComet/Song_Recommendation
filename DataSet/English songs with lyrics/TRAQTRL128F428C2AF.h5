Mai falls like a star at a feather's pace into my heart<SEP>With the dragon's weight<SEP>And police make siren sounds wind down my street to take<SEP>The breath from my lungs sweet<SEP>I tried so hard to cover up this taste,<SEP>It's like a sinner's constant fall from grace<SEP>I changed my name, my voice, my face<SEP>I killed my name, my voice, my pace<SEP>And antibiotics on the sixteenth day of Mai<SEP>I lost my will<SEP>Forms a new fate this reoccurring theme has killed my faith<SEP>IT's drowning me in stereo and waste<SEP>And all my bridges burn together<SEP>And now my city lights are turning down this thin white line<SEP>I follow blind, you tried to help me but I have to drown<SEP>Acts of faith the makeup on my sinner's face<SEP>I run so hard at absent pace to cover up this bitter taste of waste
