It begins when the time comes in And brings forth a dead current<SEP>A motion set for certain demise<SEP>We watched them come from the depths But we couldn't see it till we looked in their eyes<SEP>Behind the mask, the demon resides<SEP>The meat was stripped from their bones<SEP>We destroy!<SEP>Burn it all down<SEP>Put them back underground This is a day that I promise<SEP>You will not forget<SEP>With the heart of a warrior, I rise with all I have left<SEP>I watched as the walls crumbled backed Backed with a burning sky, legions fell<SEP>They left with a mission complete<SEP>Genocide fulfilled; leave me for dead<SEP>Miscreation of revenge beats through my veins<SEP>Empires that once rivaled us fell from the sky<SEP>Beg for life as you return to the Earth<SEP>The world will bow to me
