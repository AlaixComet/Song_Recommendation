I shut my eyes and it all comes racing in<SEP>Everytime it rains, I can feel you on my skin<SEP>A storm of chance when fate was hard to find<SEP>Seven days that we left behind<SEP>Left behind<SEP>And everything we were, everything underneath the sun<SEP>The waves kept crashing and a storm had just begun<SEP>Forces colliding to one moment in time<SEP>Seven days, when it rained, you'd shine<SEP>Remember the nights? Remember the days?<SEP>Remember the vacation rain?<SEP>Remember the way life used to taste?<SEP>Remember the vacation rain, rain?<SEP>Rain, rain<SEP>The earth was shaking and the ground was getting wet<SEP>The time we were taking, I never will forget<SEP>The summer winds were changing and coming to an end<SEP>Seven days we'd never see again<SEP>Remember the nights? Remember the days?<SEP>Remember the vacation rain?<SEP>Remember the way life used to taste?<SEP>Remember the vacation rain, rain?<SEP>Rain, rain<SEP>Don't it take you back<SEP>Like a photograph<SEP>Hanging in your mind frame?<SEP>Wish that I could go back<SEP>But the fact is<SEP>It never feels the same<SEP>When it rains<SEP>Every now and then I wanna feel that way again<SEP>Seven days<SEP>Remember the night? Remember the days?<SEP>Remember the vacation rain?<SEP>Remember the way life used to taste?<SEP>Remember the vacation rain?(<SEP>Ooh)<SEP>The crash of the waves that we felt break<SEP>Remember the vacation rain, rain, rain?
