That's all I want to say before I'll start to be so fucking bored '<SEP>Cause I can't deal to keep myself Far away from my own consciousness That's just a little tip for you So please don't show me gratitude It's just about to go ahead And throw out the shit from your wasted head You're driving me crazy crazy Standing out and chasing your own way Try to find the path of a new day Don't be out from this But keep it rolling 'til your life is changing! Look, what I tried to say, I know Sounds like an easy way to go<SEP>And I will never understand Why don't you keep staying on your track?<SEP>Solutions live inside of you There's nothing I can ever do To help you getting over that Pulling out your mind from this crazy trap You're driving me crazy crazy Standing out and chasing your own way Try to find the path of a new day Don't be out from this But keep it rolling 'til your life is changing! Standing out and chasing your own dreams Try to find the path of a new breeze Don't be out from this But keep it rolling 'til your life is changing!
