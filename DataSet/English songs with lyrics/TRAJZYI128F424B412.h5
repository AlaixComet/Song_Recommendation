Oh, she never had a chance  Oh, she was only five years old  Pity the poor darling now  Oh, she never had a chance  Death come quick  For a girl  Victim of a homicide  Brutally raped  Cut and beaten  The five year old  Didn't escape  Her mom and friend  Cigarette burns  To hit her again  Did her in  On her arms  From her mom and her friend  He had a whip  Do you wanna party? It's partytime  We gotta party! It's partytime  Oh, she never had a chance  Oh, she was only five years old  Oh, she never had a chance  She was unaware  Her grand mother  Her older sister  Except Veronica  Was sent to jail  She wasn't loved  Where ever she is  It's partytime  For a dime  We gotta party/<SEP>It's partytime  Do you wanna party/<SEP>It's partytime  We gotta party/<SEP>It's partytime  It's partytime  Do you wanna party/<SEP>It's partytime  It's partytime  It's partytime  It's partytime
