Took a left turn at Albuquerque<SEP>You went north and I went south<SEP>It's just time so don't you worry, Hard to wait but patience pays<SEP>Open my door the cupboard's bare<SEP>It's hard to give when nothing's there<SEP>All this shit and such confusion, Tell myself it's not an illusion<SEP>We need some space between us<SEP>Take a deep breath, Clear my head<SEP>We need some space between us<SEP>Fall the wall, And build a bridge<SEP>We need some space between us<SEP>Don't go out and get a New thing<SEP>Hey - Hey - Hey<SEP>I've been here it's so familiar, Close the book I know the end<SEP>Want so much a different story, Want so much a different way<SEP>Just so much well its just so much<SEP>And I'm up too close and I just can't see<SEP>Tryin' to think before I answer<SEP>And I'm trying' to walk before I run<SEP>Chorus - first verse - chorus<SEP>Hey - Hey - Hey!
