Too long in trouble, I wish it would end.<SEP>Could we live side by side, could we be friends?<SEP>We're not all the same, I know this is true.<SEP>But I am just me, and you are just you. We tell our own lives, we live all thus.<SEP>The old dreams don't die, the memories last.<SEP>But to die for a dream, is such a tragic romance.<SEP>Prejudice and pride, a dangerous dance. Oh hear the pipes playing, take up your stance.<SEP>And our children will pay for our dangerous dance. And the best part of reason, gets lost in time.<SEP>Not just off old books, it's still in our eyes.<SEP>And there's beauty in old books, when there's truth on the page.<SEP>And when we're all gone, what will the books say? Oh hear the pipes playing, take up your stance.<SEP>And our children will pay for our dangerous dance. Oh hear the pipes playing, take up your stance.<SEP>And our children will pay for our dangerous dance.
