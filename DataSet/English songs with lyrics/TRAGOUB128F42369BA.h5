You're a ticking clock in a timeless land<SEP>Holding on too long without any hands<SEP>And the stars are falling down around you now<SEP>In the rain there are wonders left to touch<SEP>So you're reaching out<SEP>Hold on to me while I<SEP>Hold on to my Father's hand(<SEP>God will heal you, make you, like new)<SEP>Time will bring you to<SEP>My Father's hands<SEP>So the flowers grow and bloom in the desert sand<SEP>And the crystal tears they fall and flower in a barren land<SEP>Till you feel the sunlight shining on your skin<SEP>And all that once was lost in you is alive again
