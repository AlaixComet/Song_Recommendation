I was born a country girl; I will die a country girl<SEP>My world is made of blue skies and sunshine<SEP>Green fields and butterflies<SEP>I'm so glad I'm a country girl<SEP>Birds sing good morning to a country girl<SEP>And I sleep to the sounds of whip-o-wills<SEP>My day is made with puppies and kittens meadows and daisies<SEP>I'm so glad I'm a country girl<SEP>Running over hills playing in the woods free breezes blowing<SEP>Honey bees are swarming, black birds are flying, wonder where they're going<SEP>Picking stick-me-tights off my gingham dress darkness is falling<SEP>Firewood to carry eggs to gather and supper's ready mamma's calling<SEP>I was born a country girl and I will die a country girl<SEP>My world is made of blue skies and sunshine<SEP>Green fields and butterflies<SEP>I'm so glad I'm a country girl<SEP>Oh I'm so happy I'm a country girl
