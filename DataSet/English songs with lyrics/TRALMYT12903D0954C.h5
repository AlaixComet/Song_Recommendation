Nothing can stop him now no one can top him now I guess I'll have to let him go Up, up, up, the ladder of success (up, up, up, up.) Once he let me share his dreams But now that they come true it seems He doesn't want my love I guess look there goes my happiness They're climbin' up up up the ladder of success (<SEP>The ladder of success.) Things are like he said they'd be I thought his plans included me He forgot his words of love fame is all he's thinking of A going up up up up the ladder of success (<SEP>The ladder of success.) I liked him better in his white dungarees When he was all mine with patches on his knees (<SEP>With patches on his knees) When his name went up in lights All I got were lonely nights. He doesn't want my love I guess Look there goes my happiness A goin' up up up up the ladder of success (<SEP>Climbin' up whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...)
