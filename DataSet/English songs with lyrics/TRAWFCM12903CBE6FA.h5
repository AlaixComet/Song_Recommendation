Tell us, Kurbads, where have you been In the foreign lands what you have seen? People have long sung songs about you Of devils and monsters you have fought I have been in the Underworld Can anyone believe that? I chopped down three devils there And saved the king's daughter Tell us, Kurbads, say the truth How did you descend into the Underworld? Did it really go easy for you? And how did you ever return back home? It was hard down there But I had powerful words with me * They helped and protected me Even Laima herself paved my way The Snake Witch bit my rope in two I fell back And was forced to go and find another way out The monstrous werewolf I overcame I helped a blind man Regain his eyesight The nestling of a great eagle I saved from the hail For such deeds Eagle repaid me greatly Great eagle carried me Out to the surface Then I arrived home at last That's how it was That's what happened to me in the Underworld I was born a child of iron A mother of steel gave me life I put on a jacket of iron A coat made of steel They struck at me, stabbed at me Like a block of oak They couldn't hit or stab me Like to a chunk of steel
