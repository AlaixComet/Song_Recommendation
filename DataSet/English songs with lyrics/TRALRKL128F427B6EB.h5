You took me home<SEP>I drank too much<SEP>Because of you, my liver turned to dust<SEP>Cold rust taste a cruel creeping cold pain<SEP>Do you understand what I mean?<SEP>When you feel your soul drop to the floor<SEP>Like a hole, like an open bleeding sore<SEP>Then you'll have bled like I've bled<SEP>Then you'll have wept as I've wept!<SEP>Suck me down, it's time to rock and roll<SEP>Let's hit the bar, let's lose control<SEP>One false move; you took me home<SEP>One false move; you're all alone<SEP>But it looks so good, and it feels so nice<SEP>I paid the price<SEP>I'll cut you out, just to hear you scream<SEP>Get away from, get away from me<SEP>And I can feel my heartbeat racing<SEP>As I realize what I must do<SEP>Get away from, get away from, get away from you.<SEP>I should have turned and ran like hell<SEP>Last time I got a taste of you<SEP>I should have turned and ran like hell<SEP>And I'll say we're through<SEP>I should have turned and ran like hell<SEP>The Last time I got a taste of you<SEP>I should say we're through<SEP>You fell upon me like a plague<SEP>Weakness (sweet weakness)<SEP>But I digress<SEP>After all this, you're just like all the rest<SEP>Suck me down, it's time to rock and roll<SEP>Let's hit the bar, let's loose control<SEP>One false move; you took me home<SEP>One false move; you're all alone
