Rain falls down on the desert sand<SEP>And the flowers cover the land<SEP>They’ve been waiting patiently<SEP>For the right raindrop to set 'em free<SEP>Well ain’t it just like love<SEP>I thought there was none<SEP>That was when I found one<SEP>On a dark night in a southern town<SEP>You called to me and I turned around<SEP>In a perfect moment when the stars aligned<SEP>You couldn’t have come at a better time<SEP>And every day in my life had led me to<SEP>That perfect moment with you<SEP>Lucky that we did not meet<SEP>Ten years back on the street<SEP>So many pages yet to turn<SEP>So many dreams still to burn<SEP>Oh but I don’t cry for the wasted years<SEP>Or the twisted roads that got me here<SEP>I have been to the end of the earth<SEP>And I know what standing still is worth<SEP>In a perfect moment when the stars aligned<SEP>Love don’t travel in straight lines<SEP>And every day of my life had led me to<SEP>That perfect moment with you<SEP>Well the wheel of fortune is going round and round<SEP>I never thought I would come up when I was down<SEP>But a perfect moment when the stars aligned<SEP>When you put your hand in mine<SEP>And every day of my life has led me to<SEP>That perfect moment<SEP>Every day of my life has led me to<SEP>This perfect moment with you
