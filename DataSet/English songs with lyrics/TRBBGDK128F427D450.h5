Oh my Maria<SEP>Seems you got me in your spell once more<SEP>Must be there's a storm on the way<SEP>You taught me to know when you're near<SEP>In your glance<SEP>Recall my shady days of youth<SEP>Stealing altar wine and microphones<SEP>Not so blindly fueling my need<SEP>As rock and roll fueled my dreams<SEP>You know rock and roll fueled my dreams<SEP>Back then you saw me as this child<SEP>In great need of the wildest sin<SEP>How sweet your grace I stumbled in<SEP>And how completely you waved<SEP>As I laughed in your face<SEP>Oh my Maria<SEP>Oh my Maria<SEP>How you stood for strength and sanity<SEP>Now is there someone poking holes in thee<SEP>I see now why you called me near<SEP>Maria my song can you hear<SEP>I know you see the silence on the sidewalk<SEP>And the anger in the street<SEP>And the voices of all these children<SEP>Coming up to my feet<SEP>And we sing your song in vain<SEP>As some preacher sees his reign<SEP>Come down<SEP>Maria<SEP>Oh my sweet, Maria<SEP>In the silence on the hill<SEP>You know I'll be dreaming of you still<SEP>Maria, oh my Maria<SEP>I sing for my Maria<SEP>I sing for my Maria
