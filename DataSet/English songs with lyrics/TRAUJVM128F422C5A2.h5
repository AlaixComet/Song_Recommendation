Whisper something to me so I can hear your voice I'm pushing you away, my will be done, it is my choice You sing to me in inky black with tendrils flailing wildly Yet I remain in solid stone, no force on earth will move me Why does it seem that all is slipping further from me? I build and build and reaching up my arms can not reach anything Give me something, anything Why is it bleak and barren Don't I deserve the world after building building building? You dangle happiness before me yet keep it out of reach My well is dry and still I try to fill it up I seek and seek and seek Nothing lasts except the empty swallowing my soul But I will rise above this world and I will fill my holes My heart and soul belong to me, I am my own My own my own I am a fire I eat the world and defecate the shell
