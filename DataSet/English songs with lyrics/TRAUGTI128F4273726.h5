What can I do?<SEP>I want you addicted to me...<SEP>What in the world is a girl to do?<SEP>When in this smokey place I only see you<SEP>Was far away when you caught my eye<SEP>You've brought me back and now you're making me high<SEP>I was alone out there, with no one else around<SEP>Now I've fallen for you, and there's no coming down<SEP>Till there was you, I know what you're needing<SEP>My thoughts are leading, me straight into your eyes<SEP>What can I do? I'm looking right at you<SEP>This feeling is all new, I want you addicted to me<SEP>Fate can act in a curious way<SEP>When all that mattered means nothing today<SEP>All that concerns me, that drenches my thoughts<SEP>Is the sensation that seeing you brought<SEP>I was alone out there, with no one else around<SEP>Now I've fallen for you, and there's no coming down<SEP>And there's no coming down...<SEP>Till there was you... What can I do..?<SEP>Till there was you, I know what you're needing<SEP>My thoughts are leading, me straight into your eyes<SEP>What can I do? I'm looking right at you<SEP>This feeling is all new, I want you addicted to me<SEP>And there's no coming down...
