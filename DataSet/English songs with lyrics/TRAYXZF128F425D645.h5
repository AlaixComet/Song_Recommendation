Well, my daddy left home when I was three<SEP>And he didn't leave much to Ma and me<SEP>Just this ole guitar and an empty bottle of booze<SEP>Now, I don't blame him 'cause he run and hid<SEP>But the meanest thing that he ever did<SEP>Was before he left, he went and named me Sue<SEP>Well, he musta thought that it was quite a joke<SEP>And it got a lot of laughs from lots a folks<SEP>Seems I had to fight my whole life through<SEP>Some gal would giggle and I'd get red<SEP>And some guy'd laugh and I'd bust his head<SEP>I'll tell ya, life ain't easy for a boy named Sue<SEP>Well, I grew up quick and I grew up mean<SEP>My fist got hard and my wits got keen<SEP>I roamed from town to town to hide my shame<SEP>But I made me a vow to the Moon and stars<SEP>I'd search the honky-tonks and bars<SEP>And kill that man that give me that awful name<SEP>Well, it was Gatlinburg in mid-<SEP>July<SEP>And I'd just hit town and my throat was dry<SEP>I thought I'd stop and have myself a brew<SEP>At an old saloon on a street of mud<SEP>There at a table dealin' stud<SEP>Sat the dirty, mangey dog that named me Sue<SEP>Well I knew that snake was my own sweet dad<SEP>From a worn out picture that my mother had<SEP>And I knew that scar on his cheek and his evil eye<SEP>He was big and bent and grey and old<SEP>And I looked at him and my blood ran cold, and I said"<SEP>My name is Sue!  How do you do?  Now you gonna die!"<SEP>Yeah!  That's what I told him<SEP>Well, I hit him hard right between the eyes<SEP>And he went down but to my surprise<SEP>Came up with a knife an' cut off a piece of my ear<SEP>I busted a chair right across his teeth<SEP>And we crashed through the wall and into the street<SEP>Kickin' and a-gougin' in the mud and the blood and the beer<SEP>I tell ya, I've fought tougher men<SEP>But I really can't remember when<SEP>He kicked like a mule and he bit like a crocodile<SEP>Well, I heard him laugh and then I heard him cuss<SEP>He went for his gun but I pulled mine first<SEP>He stood there lookin' at me and I saw him smile<SEP>And he said, "<SEP>Son, this world is rough<SEP>And if a man's gonna make it he's gotta be tough<SEP>And I know I wouldn't be there to help you along<SEP>So I gave you that name and I said goodbye<SEP>I knew you'd have to get tough or die<SEP>And it's that name that helped to make you strong"<SEP>Yeah!  He said, "<SEP>Now you just fought one hell of a fight<SEP>And I know you hate me and ya got the right<SEP>To kill me now and I wouldn't blame you if you do<SEP>But you oughta thank me before I die<SEP>For the gravel in your guts and the spit in the eye'<SEP>Cause I'm the son-of-a-bitch that named you Sue"<SEP>Yeah, what could I do?  What could I do?<SEP>I got all choked up and threw down my gun<SEP>Called him my Pa and he called me his son<SEP>And I come away with a different point of view<SEP>And I think about him now and then<SEP>Every time I try and every time I win<SEP>And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him<SEP>Bill or George, any-damn-thing but Sue!  I still hate that name!
