I know I've been what's in your mind You could use it, babe If ever I could let you go Is that hard to take It's not often You soften up enough to smile I'm damaged, I'm sandwiched In here for a while Tomorrow it's the last event That you'll be a man Forget what you thought she meant Thank her, wish her well<SEP>I'm damaged, I'm sandwiched In the tree of light It's no wonder I'm under And no strength to fight If ever there had been a time Would you let me know? Is there enough of you around Could you let some go? All the love won't deny you You're above all you cry to Gave it all I could think of Wish you'd get what you're on the brink of All the love won't deny you You're above all you cry to Gave it all I could think of Wish you'd get what you're on the brink of All the love
