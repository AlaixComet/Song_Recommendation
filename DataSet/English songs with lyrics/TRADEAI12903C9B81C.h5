You never saw me comin' With your naive eyes You're the right kind of spirit With the right kind of time Now you don't pay attention We get off with a bang Your reckless obsession Washed away all your shine I'm you disease You embrace my infection When I cross your lips You pretend not to notice When I tighten my grip I'm your brand-new monkey On your back if you please Gonna show you no mercy When I feed your disease I'm your disease I could never ignore you Any time that we meet No sign of it slowin' When you're dead on your feet I'm your brand-new monkey On your back if you please Gonna show you no mercy When I feed your disease I'm your disease
