The cops are hanging around the house<SEP>The cars outside look like they've got the blues<SEP>The moon don't know if it's day or night<SEP>Everybody's creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes<SEP>You're making coffee for everyone concerned<SEP>Someone points to this and someone points to that<SEP>Everyone is saying that you should lie down<SEP>But you ain't having none of that<SEP>And I say to the sleepy summer rain<SEP>With a complete absence of pain<SEP>You might think I'm crazy<SEP>But I'm still in love with you<SEP>Hide your eyes, hide your tears,<SEP>Hide your face, my love<SEP>Hide your ribbons, hide your bows<SEP>Hide your coloured cotton gloves<SEP>Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures<SEP>Hide your neatly scissored locks<SEP>Hide your memories, hide them all<SEP>Stuff them in a cardboard box<SEP>Or throw them into the street below<SEP>Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow<SEP>For you might think I'm crazy<SEP>But I'm still in love with you<SEP>Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call<SEP>Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all<SEP>Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs<SEP>One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair<SEP>The other one resting on your hip<SEP>Without a solitary care<SEP>I fall to sleep in the summer rain<SEP>With no single memory of pain<SEP>And you might think I'm crazy<SEP>But I'm still in love with you
