O brother where are you? (<SEP>Face forward and stop thinking.)<SEP>Do you admit regret in times of doubt? (<SEP>We will think for you.)<SEP>A life of gun in hand, with a dedication to your land,<SEP>Inside out you've shown it's not what life's all about.<SEP>No, we cannot believe in what you said,<SEP>When your whole life's been a sacrifice mislead.<SEP>But we still hold the pride.<SEP>When the gun smoke clears, we'll still salute you.<SEP>When you return by the tide, we'll be here to see your life through.<SEP>I'm confused and punctured. My conscience is my only means of direction.<SEP>Did I sign up for suicide, or a saddened bride?<SEP>Three more years, no white picket fencing, suffering a mental conviction.<SEP>Please, don't you think that now we will look down<SEP>On a man who's realized what's true to him now?<SEP>It's not giving up, it's seeing what else there's to see.<SEP>When you're soon set free, there is so much more than a camouflaged hell.<SEP>So cock the gun and fire into the eyes of a great desire.<SEP>A fleeting destiny has turned into what's considered to be normal.<SEP>And I'm here for you.
