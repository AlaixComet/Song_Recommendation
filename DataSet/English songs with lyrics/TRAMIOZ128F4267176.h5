The sun slither down behind the sycomore tree,<SEP>The wind rolled in to cool me about there grins,<SEP>It's been to hot mama, you know it's been to warm,<SEP>It will be alright when the summer is gone, oh yeah.<SEP>The fish ain't been biting but my hook is wet,<SEP>Ain't seen no rain since the day I left,<SEP>Take a drink of water when your throat is dry,<SEP>I'm gonna sit on the dam all through the night, yeah lord.<SEP>Hear the bullfrogs croaking all around the pond,<SEP>Sounds just like a concert down in New Ville Orleans,<SEP>Streams through the forest just like the blood in my arms,<SEP>And I see you in everything, I do.<SEP>Boy I pack my bags, I hit the road,<SEP>I own a streatch of land, got me a Fish and Hold,<SEP>Gonna sit right here until I clear my head,<SEP>Guz I see you in everything, yeah I do.<SEP>But I love you now, just like I loved you then,<SEP>I'm getting a little too old to try and pretend,<SEP>There will be another to compare with you,<SEP>Guz I see you in everything, I do.<SEP>Bit there are no answers, its just a road you're on,<SEP>If you don't open up your eyes, soon it will all be gone,<SEP>Breez through the forest, just like the breath in my lungs,<SEP>Now I see you in everything.
