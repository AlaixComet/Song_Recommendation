"<SEP>As I raise my head to broadcast my objection<SEP>As your latest triumph draws the final straw Who died and lifted you up to perfection?<SEP>And what silenced me is written into law. I can't believe where circumstance has thrown me<SEP>And I turn my head away<SEP>If I look I'm not sure that I could face you.<SEP>Not again. Not today. Not today.<SEP>If hatred makes a play on me tomorrow<SEP>And forgiveness take a back seat to revenge<SEP>There's a hurt down deep that has not been corrected<SEP>There's a voice in me that says you will not win.<SEP>And if I ignore the voice inside,<SEP>Raise a half glass to my home.<SEP>But it's there that I am most afraid,<SEP>And forgetting doesn't hold, it doesn't hold.<SEP>Now I don't believe and I never did that two wrongs make a right.<SEP>If the world were filled with the likes of you then I'm putting up a fight. I'm putting up a fight. Putting up a fight. Make it right. Make it right.<SEP>Now love cannot be called into question.<SEP>Forgiveness is the only hope I hold.<SEP>And love - love will be my strongest weapon.<SEP>I do believe that I am not alone.<SEP>For this fear will not destroy me.<SEP>And the tears that have been shed<SEP>It's knowing now where I am weakest<SEP>And the voice in my head. In my head.<SEP>Then I raise my voice up higher<SEP>And I look you in the eye<SEP>And I offer love with one condition.<SEP>With conviction, tell me why.<SEP>Tell me why.<SEP>Tell me why.<SEP>Look me in the eye.<SEP>Tell me why."
