Sit here waiting by the bathroom door Hoping I might see a little more Sick of love stains on my sheets Sick of love stars I don't want to keep Look in my mind's eye Look into my mind's eye What do I know? And you? What do I know? And I don't know if I'm wrong or right And I don't know where I'll sleep tonight Sick of love stains on my sheets Sick of love stars I don't want to keep Look in my mind's eye Look into my mind's eye What do I know? And you? What do I know? What do I know? Winter came today and took the sun away What do I know? Who were you to be It's all the same to me What do I know? What do I know? And I can't tell you anything And I can't tell you anything And I can't tell you anything And I can't tell you anything And I can't tell you anything And I can't tell you anything Maybe you'll make it home You make it home
