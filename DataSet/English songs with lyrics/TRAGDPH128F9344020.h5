Baghdad kids on C<SEP>NN Have never heard the term phantom limbs A second before U<SEP>S tanks were deployed And land mines don't lie It's a shame that their city got invaded But modern first world conveniences Don't grow on trees S<SEP>UVs and the morbidly obese don't lie We love to complain, we wouldn't have it any other way I'll see you there There's nothing left to do, there's no place left for you I'll see you there Folded flags and epitaphs Fair and balanced telecasts To remind us that the job's not done But 21 guns don't lie Each and every shot makes me want to scream Over in that mess there's a kid like me That misses his friends and only wants it all to end 100,000 dead don't lie We love to complain, we wouldn't have it any other way I'll see you there There's nothing left to do, there's no place left for you I'll see you there
