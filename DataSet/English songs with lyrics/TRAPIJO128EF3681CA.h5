I've been so many places in my life and time<SEP>I've sung a lot of songs I've made some bad rhymes<SEP>I've acted out my life in stages<SEP>With ten thousand people watching<SEP>But we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you<SEP>I know your image of me is what I hope to be<SEP>I've treated you unkindly but darlin' can't you see<SEP>There's no one more important to me<SEP>Baby can't you see through me'<SEP>Cause we're alone now and I'm singing this song to you<SEP>You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing<SEP>You came out in front when I was hiding<SEP>Now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together<SEP>Listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding<SEP>I love you in a place where there's no space or time<SEP>I love you for my life you're a friend of mine<SEP>And when my life is over<SEP>Remember when we were together<SEP>We were alone and I was singing this song to you<SEP>We were alone and I was singing this song to you<SEP>We were alone and I was singing this song to you
