I'm in a phone booth, baby Number scratched on the wall I'm in a phone booth, baby Number scratched on the wall I'm new in Chicago Got no one else to call Been walkin' all day For old friends I can't find Hearts so cold Had to buy me some wine Calling you, baby Took my very last dime I'm in a phone booth, baby Number scratched up on the wall I'm in a phone booth, baby Number scratched on the wall I'm new in Chicago Got no one else to call Said call Big Rita Anytime, day or night You know I'm broke and I'm cold, baby And I hope you'll treat me right I'm in a phone booth, baby With the cold wind right outside
