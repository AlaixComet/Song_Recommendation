These days are closing in<SEP>The end has become apparent<SEP>We're only here for so long<SEP>Will anyone remember my name<SEP>When time has washed away the dust of our ashes?<SEP>When my head rests in a velvet lined casket<SEP>What's out there?<SEP>What is my eternal fate?<SEP>It only just recently hit me<SEP>That this life is just a state<SEP>Mortality fading, like the innocence of love<SEP>I'm scared to death of what's to become<SEP>Of my immortal soul of this eternal flame<SEP>Will you remember?<SEP>Will your heart sing with pain?<SEP>Who calls out my name?<SEP>Who can tell me what happens<SEP>When my eyes close for the last time?<SEP>Does it all simply end in a blanket of darkness?<SEP>What of my soul, what of my soul?<SEP>All those things you couldn't say<SEP>You should've said<SEP>All those I-love-you's lost<SEP>Weighed more like lead on your chest<SEP>All those things you couldn't say<SEP>You should've said<SEP>All those I-love-you's lost<SEP>Weighed more like lead on your chest<SEP>Of my immortal soul of this eternal flame<SEP>Will you remember?<SEP>Will your heart sing with pain?<SEP>Who calls out my name?<SEP>Who can tell me what happens<SEP>When my eyes close for the last time?<SEP>Does it all simply end in a blanket of darkness?<SEP>What of my soul, what of my soul?<SEP>What if I could take back all those misspent days?<SEP>Every second of anger, I would wash my sins away<SEP>Who calls out my name?<SEP>Who can tell me what happens<SEP>When my eyes close for the last time?<SEP>Does it all simply end in a blanket of darkness?<SEP>What of my soul, what of my soul?<SEP>Who calls out my name?<SEP>Who can tell me what happens<SEP>When my eyes close for the last time?<SEP>Does it all simply end in a blanket of darkness?<SEP>What of my soul, what of my soul?
