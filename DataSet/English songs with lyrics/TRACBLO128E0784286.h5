There's a pulse in the new-born sun;<SEP>A beat in the heat of noon;<SEP>There's a song as the day grows long,<SEP>And a tempo in the tides of the moon.<SEP>It's all around us and it's everywhere,<SEP>And it's deeper than Royal blue.<SEP>And it feels so real you can feel the feeling!<SEP>And that's The Majesty Of Rock!<SEP>The fantasy of Roll!<SEP>The ticking of the clock,<SEP>The wailing of the soul!<SEP>The prisoner in the dock,<SEP>The digger in the hole,<SEP>We're in this together... and ever...<SEP>In the shade of a jungle glade,<SEP>Or the rush of the crushing street,<SEP>On the plain, on the foamy main,<SEP>You can never escape from the beat.<SEP>It's in the mud and it's in your blood<SEP>And its conquest is complete.<SEP>And all that you can do is just surrender.<SEP>To the Majesty of Rock!<SEP>The Pageantry of Roll!<SEP>The crowing of the cock,<SEP>The running of the foal!<SEP>The shepherd with his flock,<SEP>The miner with his coal,<SEP>We're in this together... and ever...<SEP>When we die, do we haunt the sky?<SEP>Do we lurk in the murk of the seas?<SEP>What then?
