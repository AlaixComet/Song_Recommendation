No use ignoring me, I represent the darkest thing you feel. No use avoiding me, I'm woven in the fabric of your being. Don't back away from me, I feed on apprehension and fear. Don't back away from me, don't blind yourself to what you really should be seeing. A part of you that will consume if given the chance to, A part of you that will abuse whenever allowed to. A part of you that will consume if given the chance to, A part of you that wants to see you loose it all. C'mon, see what you get. C'mon, when will you Come to terms with what's inside,<SEP>Come to terms with what you try to hide.<SEP>Emotion overload, might really mean the end of the road. Emotion overload, might mean the end of everything you know.<SEP>Emotional check, just might reveal emotional wreck. Emotional check, just might reveal your weakness 'cause you've finished.
