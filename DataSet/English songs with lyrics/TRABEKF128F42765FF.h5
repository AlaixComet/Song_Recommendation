And when I open my eyes I see the end of<SEP>An ending life I've forgotten how to live.<SEP>I keep forgetting, I keep rebuilding.<SEP>This is when I say I'm done.<SEP>I haven't learned.<SEP>No one will show me, so I go on my own.<SEP>Honestly, I'm so fucking pitiful.<SEP>Don't tell me what I've heard before.<SEP>Destined to walk another day alone.<SEP>This day is dying.<SEP>This day is fucking dead.<SEP>Just shine my way back home.<SEP>You can stay if you find comfort.<SEP>Don't speak.<SEP>Just breathe instead.<SEP>Just don't leave me alone.<SEP>I don't just need it, I deserve it.<SEP>I want what I promised myself.<SEP>I want what you promised us all.<SEP>I'm coming to terms.<SEP>This is the end of denial.<SEP>Sometimes things just fall apart.<SEP>Angels laugh above me and demons wait below.<SEP>I'm naked, bare, and broken, ready to go home.<SEP>Now I need you more than ever.<SEP>And when heaven overlooks me I'll need you there to pick me back up
