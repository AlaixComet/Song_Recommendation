Who can calm the raging storm? Who can keep me safe from harm?<SEP>Who has an everlasting arm? Nobody else, nobody else<SEP>And when I am lost, can't find my way When I am scared of come what may<SEP>Who is my shelter and my strength? Nobody else, nobody else<SEP>Blessed be Your name Blessed be the One who men and angels praise<SEP>Blessed be Your name You are God and forever you reign You are God and forever you reign<SEP>Who can wash away my sin? Who can cleanse me deep within?<SEP>Who conquered death and rose again? Nobody else, nobody else<SEP>And when life is beautiful and new When I've lost everything but you<SEP>Whose promises will see me through? Nobody else, nobody else
