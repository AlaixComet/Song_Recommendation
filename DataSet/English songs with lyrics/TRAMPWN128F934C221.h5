Capture your soul with a vengeful feast I will hunt down and conquer Send your best to the grave For your crime they all will pay I lurk in the shadows, entombed in spite-filled rage No crow will escape the blade For your crime, they all will pay Hell on your earth Hell's wrath brought on your head Hell on your Earth For your crime' I've suffered They'll pay with their blood Hell on your Earth Hell's wrath brought on your head Hell on your earth Hell's wrath brought on your head Hell on your Earth For your crime, I've suffered I've suffered A 20 year way ends at last This revered soldier lays his vengeance down
