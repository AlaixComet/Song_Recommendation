We gotta get to a higher place<SEP>And we gotta leave by night<SEP>Before that river takes us down<SEP>We gotta find somewhere that's dry<SEP>We gotta run like we've never run,<SEP>Or we're gonna lose the light.<SEP>If we don't get to a higher place and<SEP>Find somebody who can help somebody,<SEP>Might be nobody no more<SEP>Well, I fool myself and I don't know why<SEP>I thought we could ride this out<SEP>I was up all night making up my mind<SEP>But now I got my doubts<SEP>I got my eye on the waterline<SEP>Trying to keep my sense of humor<SEP>But if we don't get to a higher place and<SEP>Find somebody who can help somebody,<SEP>Might be nobody no more<SEP>We gotta get to a higher place<SEP>And I hope we all arrive together<SEP>We gotta get to a higher place<SEP>If we wanna survive the weather<SEP>I remember walking with her in town,<SEP>Her hair was in the wind<SEP>I gave her my best kiss<SEP>She gave it back again<SEP>When I add up what I've left behind<SEP>I don't want to lose no more<SEP>But if we don't get to a higher place and<SEP>Find somebody who can help somebody,<SEP>Might be nobody no more
