This year the harvest was washed away<SEP>Borne on the back of a black water water wave<SEP>Drown the eastern seaboard and lap at the southern plains<SEP>All in all it's a hell of a day to ride the high horse down the straight and narrow<SEP>To deliverance<SEP>I can harness the cosmos in the palm of my hand<SEP>Bring the earth to a grinding halt by single silent command<SEP>Lay the mountains asunder, turn oceans to dry land<SEP>I've found the key that unlocks the shackles of gravity<SEP>Stones are floating overhead suspended in perfect symmetry<SEP>And the stones they sing to me... whisper soaring melodies<SEP>Accept this offering. For the past to be buried. Sustained by longing<SEP>Breathe your life into me and cure my disease<SEP>Open the window. The center of your chest<SEP>Take an axe to the glass. Find a friend and hide<SEP>I've built a home for my sweet across the brooding sea<SEP>Every cut that I made, I thought of your face<SEP>And every stone that was laid made your image cease to fade<SEP>But alas I am scorned. Hereby sentenced henceforth to wander<SEP>In empty castles<SEP>Body is a device to calculate<SEP>Soul is the earth trodden under our feet<SEP>Mind is the beauty begging to be raped<SEP>God is a child tugging on the shirt tails of fate<SEP>The snake is charming us<SEP>Our voices will ring from skyscrapers down the ley lines<SEP>And carry out to sea<SEP>Accept this offering
