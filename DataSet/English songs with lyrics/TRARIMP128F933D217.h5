Late at night, end of the road<SEP>Headlights under headstones<SEP>Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me<SEP>Mouth is dry, heart skips a beat<SEP>Ground spinning underneath my feet<SEP>Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me<SEP>Every creak of the door, every foot step I hear<SEP>Every hollow of the wind, makes me tremble with fear, with fear<SEP>Another sleepless night, oh woh it's heavy my mind<SEP>Lord I can't escape, my conscienss thought I left it way behind<SEP>Oh woh, it's heavy on my mind<SEP>Try to sleep, but I swear I saw<SEP>Something moving down the corridor<SEP>Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me<SEP>Wake up in a cold sweat, this nightmare ain't over yet<SEP>Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me<SEP>Every portrait in every room<SEP>Seems to follow my every move<SEP>Another sleepless night, oh woh heavy my mind<SEP>Lord I can't escape, my conscienss thought I left it way behind<SEP>Oh woh, it's heavy on my mind<SEP>Every creak of the door, every foot step I hear<SEP>Oh no no. Every hollow of the wind, makes me tremble with fear, with fear<SEP>Another sleepless night, oh woh it's heavy my mind<SEP>Lord I can't escape, my conscienss the thought I left it way behind<SEP>Oh woh, it's heavy on my mind<SEP>Heavy on my mind
