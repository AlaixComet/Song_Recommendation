Before last night my heart was grey<SEP>Like my country is today<SEP>Big kaleidoscope I see<SEP>A thousand people gaze at me<SEP>To break the ice I start to sing<SEP>About a cell called everything<SEP>A cell so big a word like small<SEP>Is suitable to say it all<SEP>Is the fighting over, I lost track<SEP>Like a wave it all comes back<SEP>Same kaleidoscope I see<SEP>Someone standing next to me<SEP>It's hard to do, it's hard to try<SEP>Hard to stop wondering why<SEP>Do I keep filing every case<SEP>When the answer's on your face<SEP>You can't see her but you do<SEP>Music is transparent too<SEP>So join me, sing with all your might<SEP>Hallelujah, praise tonight<SEP>Far away and long ago<SEP>Wintertime meant feeling low<SEP>Now every single star looks bright<SEP>God was in my bed last night
