Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own<SEP>Everybody has a private world where they can be alone<SEP>Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?<SEP>Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you<SEP>I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump<SEP>If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump<SEP>I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up<SEP>But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up<SEP>I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in<SEP>I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen<SEP>Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit<SEP>Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet<SEP>And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow<SEP>In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow<SEP>One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow<SEP>Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles<SEP>In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me<SEP>I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to<SEP>Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds<SEP>Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes<SEP>But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh<SEP>They can all get fucked, just stay true to you<SEP>So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh<SEP>They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)<SEP>I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I<SEP>Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I<SEP>Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact'<SEP>Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that<SEP>I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you<SEP>Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom<SEP>I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass<SEP>Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like "<SEP>Hah!<SEP>Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, Goddamn!"<SEP>Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown<SEP>So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell<SEP>Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles<SEP>In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me<SEP>I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to<SEP>Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds<SEP>Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes<SEP>But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh<SEP>They can all get fucked, just stay true to you<SEP>So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh<SEP>They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)<SEP>Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt<SEP>We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help<SEP>Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned<SEP>Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own<SEP>I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags<SEP>Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did<SEP>I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went<SEP>I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid<SEP>Aunt Edna always told me, "<SEP>Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that"<SEP>Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this<SEP>Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old<SEP>I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more<SEP>But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description'<SEP>Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different<SEP>I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least<SEP>What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet<SEP>In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me<SEP>I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to<SEP>Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds<SEP>Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes<SEP>But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh<SEP>They can all get fucked, just stay true to you<SEP>So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh<SEP>They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)<SEP>Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own. (<SEP>Oh)<SEP>Everybody has their private world, where they can be alone. (<SEP>So)<SEP>Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? (<SEP>Oh)<SEP>Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you. (<SEP>So)<SEP>Spoken<SEP>Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.<SEP>And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.<SEP>So put 'em on and wear 'em.<SEP>Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are.<SEP>Even if it sounds corny, don't ever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful. (<SEP>So)
