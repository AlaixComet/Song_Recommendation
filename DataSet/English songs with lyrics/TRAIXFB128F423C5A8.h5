This is a crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept<SEP>Doubting, unsettling and turning around, wondering what will come next<SEP>Is this the role that you wanted to live? I was foolish to ask for so much<SEP>Without the protection and infancy's guard, it all falls apart at first touch<SEP>Watching the reel as it comes to a close, brutally taking its time<SEP>People who change for no reason at all, it's happening all of the time<SEP>Can I go on with this train of events disturbing and purging my mind?<SEP>Back out of my duties, when all's said and done. I know that I'll lose every time<SEP>Moving along in our God-given ways, safety is sat by the fire<SEP>Sanctuary from these feverish smiles, left with a mark on the door<SEP>Is this the gift that I wanted to give? Forgive and forget's what they teach<SEP>Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more and watch as they drop by the beach<SEP>This is the crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept<SEP>Turning around to the next set of lives, wondering what will come next
