My mouth's been full with the waste we made especially for a night like this.<SEP>For Quite some time now, I've carried all this weight<SEP>Just to prove to you and the rest of these critics that I can.<SEP>When my Skin stretches to fill the great growing void I'll give it all back.<SEP>Give it all back.<SEP>I'm hardening that soft spot you've been abusing all along<SEP>I think it best that you take this now'<SEP>Cause what I need is a place of my own<SEP>Another promise broken<SEP>Another word kept silent<SEP>You're saving all the bad for a rainy day<SEP>Well the sun isn't shining<SEP>When my skin stretches to fill the great growing void ill give it all back.
