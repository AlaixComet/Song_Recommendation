I woke up this morning the sun was upon me.<SEP>Days like these were made for wearing headphones.<SEP>The song in my head makes me feel that much better.<SEP>Crowds can be cool every once in a while now.<SEP>Good day<SEP>Killing some time for now.<SEP>Keep on walking around.<SEP>Till we find something now.<SEP>All around me sun's shining as I breath fresh air.'<SEP>Cause I celebrate this new day.<SEP>Only fools rush life on their way to the end.<SEP>It's coming soon enough so don't hurry it now.(<SEP>So don't hurry it now)<SEP>The street I see is changing around me.<SEP>In town I see just the same old whack crap.<SEP>On the high mega screen on the walls over me.<SEP>But this day it don't effect me!
