Will somebody wear me to the fair? Will a lady pin me in her hair? Will a child find me by a stream? Kiss my petals and weave me through a dream.<SEP>For all of these simple things and much more a flower was born<SEP>It blooms to spread love and joy faith and hope to people forlorn<SEP>Inside every man lives the seed of a flower<SEP>If he looks within he finds beauty and power<SEP>Ring all the bells sing and tell the people that be everywhere that the flower has come<SEP>Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness is gone<SEP>Throw off your fears let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born
