Cleaned up the mess I'm in, now I am born again.<SEP>Naked, spotless motion without strings.<SEP>I've flushed the filth to sea, the limbs and sharp debris,<SEP>But if that water rises, woe is me!<SEP>Hearts aren't beating, they're counting down.<SEP>Breaths aren't stolen, they're groomed and given out.<SEP>The closet is teeming with broken bones.<SEP>I'll be driven out and swallowed whole.<SEP>I walk the crooked mile with the devil on my back, Puppeteering, schemes with every step.<SEP>But I once could walk through walls and drift above it all,<SEP>Pursuing endless love to endless depths.<SEP>Hearts aren't beating, they're counting down.<SEP>Breaths aren't stolen, they're groomed and given out.<SEP>The closet is teeming with broken bones.<SEP>I'll be driven out and swallowed whole.<SEP>Object all you want, but I am not done with you. Lives will be lost. Children will grieve.<SEP>Entire nations will crumble and blood will run deep, but we will be redeemed.<SEP>You and I will be weightless, we'll stay unborn.<SEP>So death can't start the clock and love can seep through our pores.
