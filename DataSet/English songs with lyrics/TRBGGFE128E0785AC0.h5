It's come take from the ripe<SEP>It feels so still I could just die just die<SEP>It's come to reach up inside<SEP>Oh how the blood stains well on white<SEP>Ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you well<SEP>Ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you ill<SEP>It's come to rape what you hide<SEP>It fills the years with reprise, disgust, disguise<SEP>I'll burn my own funeral pyre<SEP>And from your mouth I will rise out rise out<SEP>Ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you well<SEP>Ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you ill<SEP>When the fang sinks down in<SEP>Makes your eyes white and roll right into him<SEP>When the coral shaves the skin<SEP>Disease is cheap scars are polished clean<SEP>Ooh the coral fang sinking in to make you well<SEP>Ooh the coral fang sinking to take at will
