I must make up my mind today<SEP>What to have, what to hold<SEP>A poor man's roses<SEP>Or a rich man's gold<SEP>One's as wealthy as a king in a palace<SEP>Tho' he's callous and cold<SEP>He may learn to give his heart for love<SEP>Instead of buyin' it with gold<SEP>Then the poor man's roses<SEP>And the thrill when we kiss<SEP>Will be memories of paradise<SEP>That I'll never miss<SEP>And yet the hand that brings the rose tonight<SEP>Is the hand I will hold<SEP>For the rose of love means more to me<SEP>More than any rich man's gold<SEP>Then the poor man's roses<SEP>And the thrill when we kiss<SEP>Will be memories of paradise<SEP>That I'll never miss<SEP>And yet the hand that brings the rose tonight<SEP>Is the hand I will hold<SEP>For the rose of love means more to me<SEP>More than any rich man's gold...
