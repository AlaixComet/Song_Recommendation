Got a picture of a glorious day A sunny afternoon somewhere with a view And I don 't care what it's all about As long as I'm with you And I I wanna run away with you I, I wanna run away with you Wanna get a car and just drive away Looking at the view and listening to tunes And I don't care what we talk about As long as I'm with you And I I wanna run away with you I, I wanna run away with you La da da da da da La da da da da da da La da da da da da ...<SEP>And I, I wanna run away with you<SEP>I, I wanna run away with you<SEP>I, I wanna run away with you<SEP>I, I wanna run away with you, with you
