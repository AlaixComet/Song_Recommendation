I can still see you standing there next to me in the county fair ticket line<SEP>With cotton candy in your one hand and your other hadn in mine<SEP>It seems just like yesterday, letter jackets and football games girl<SEP>We've come a long way through the years had our fair share of heartache and tears<SEP>We've had our ups and downs and turn arounds but our love was stronger than any fight<SEP>Even when we lost control we never let go we kept on hangin' on for dear life<SEP>I know no matter the size of the mountain you and me will be side by side<SEP>Baby ain't life and love one big rollercoaster ride<SEP>Back in the day we were cool and crazy like two outlaws on the run<SEP>Now making love means making babies and I swear we're having twice the fun<SEP>It's been no walk in the park but then again that's not our style<SEP>It wouldn't be too entertaining without a little drama every once in awhile<SEP>Baby you still drive me crazy, you still make my heart skip a beat<SEP>With those butterfly first time feelings you've always kept me on the edge of my seat
