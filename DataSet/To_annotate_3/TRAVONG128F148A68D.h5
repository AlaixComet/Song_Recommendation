When the road is too lonely walking out in the rain<SEP>Through a faceless crowd where no one knows your name<SEP>Remember He's with you every stop of the way<SEP>Leading you through the endless maze<SEP>You can't find the forest on a hillside of trees<SEP>And you can't make sense of anything that you see<SEP>He'll sit beside you make you understand<SEP>The last shall be first, the lame will stand<SEP>All your life, wherever you go, wherever you are<SEP>He's by your side, He's leading you through the dark<SEP>Chorus: Every smile and every tear<SEP>Every hope and all your fears<SEP>Journeys reaching near or far<SEP>He will lead you like a guiding star, oh<SEP>Every night and every day<SEP>When you leave and if you stay<SEP>Closer than your beating heart<SEP>Please believe, He's everywhere you are<SEP>When you can never begin to find the end of your tears<SEP>When your heart cries loud and no one seems to hear<SEP>The river is wide, He'll take you by the hand<SEP>You'll walk on the water to dry land<SEP>All your life, wherever you go, wherever you are<SEP>He's by your side, and He's leading you through the dark<SEP>Chorus: Every smile and every tear<SEP>Every hope and all your fears<SEP>Journeys reaching near or far<SEP>He will lead you like a guiding star, oh<SEP>Every night and every day<SEP>When you leave and if you stay<SEP>Closer than your beating heart<SEP>Please believe, He's everywhere you are<SEP>Sun and rain, moonlit haze<SEP>Know that He will find you<SEP>In all your pain, loss or gain<SEP>Please believe<SEP>Chorus: Every smile and every tear<SEP>Every hope and all your fears<SEP>Journeys reaching near or far<SEP>Oh, He'll lead you like a guiding star, oh<SEP>Every night and every day<SEP>When you leave and if you stay<SEP>Closer than your beating heart<SEP>Please believe, He's everywhere you are<SEP>He's everywhere you are...
