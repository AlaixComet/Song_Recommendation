Burn all the bridges<SEP>Let me feel the wind<SEP>Will you save my soul tonight<SEP>Follow the ashes<SEP>No-one ever will<SEP>Can I hear you sing tonight<SEP>Autumn is coming<SEP>Evenings growing cold<SEP>And we still have far to go<SEP>Far goes the memory<SEP>Further than the road<SEP>And the fields that lie beyond<SEP>And every word I have said, I have sung<SEP>Every fragment of meaning has gone<SEP>But I turn around to the dust left behind<SEP>Where the threads of the rhyme come undone<SEP>You came a-knocking<SEP>Stranger at my door<SEP>Will you be my friend tonight<SEP>Turned down the lights and<SEP>Said my last goodbye<SEP>And I left my house behind<SEP>And though the sky it was dark it was cold<SEP>And the wind tore the rags off my back<SEP>You came along and your cloak it was shelter<SEP>For two who were lost in the storm
