Day is fading, but baby, I don't mind'<SEP>Cause sunlight is dancing in your eyes<SEP>And time is frozen but somehow flying by<SEP>Here with your hand holding mine<SEP>It just feels right kissing on a Sunday<SEP>I'll hold you tight as if it were the last day<SEP>With all my might, I will keep the world away<SEP>It just feels right kissing you on a Sunday<SEP>Time is racing to the sound of my heart beating<SEP>Can the dreaming escape this life<SEP>Unfair, maybe, but know that I'm not leaving<SEP>Right now, baby, life is kind<SEP>Make this moment last for a lifetime<SEP>Don't let it slip away<SEP>Play it over and over like your favorite song<SEP>And we'll fit forever in a day
