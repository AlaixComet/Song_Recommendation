I was so blind.<SEP>I couldn't see the truth.<SEP>I was unable to see how my life was being used.<SEP>To be something so miniscule.<SEP>Everything I thought was so definite,<SEP>I thought was so real was thrown away and will be remembered among unpaling hatred.<SEP>Consider my suffering.<SEP>Through all your pain.<SEP>Remember my face.<SEP>I'm digging your grave.<SEP>Since when was so sacred,<SEP>Turning into something so wrong.<SEP>Something so important to me.<SEP>Cheapened and exploited.<SEP>I won't be that way, I can't, I can't be that way again.<SEP>I can't, I won't, I will never let it.<SEP>For the rest of your fucking<SEP>Life you will mark my words.
