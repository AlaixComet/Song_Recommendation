How could you You are the river Pour out of this life How could you You are the morning bird Who sang me into life every day Fly away You are the blood of me The harvest of my dreams There's nowhere I can find peace And the silence won't cease Nothing's quite how it seems The ghost of my joy Won't let me be If you set me free I will not run I will not run I will not run
