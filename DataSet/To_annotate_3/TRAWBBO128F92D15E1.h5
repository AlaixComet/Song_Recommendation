Cold Cold Heart<SEP>By Charlie Rich<SEP>I've tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream.<SEP>Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme.<SEP>A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart.<SEP>Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?<SEP>Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue.<SEP>And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do.<SEP>In anger, unkind words I said that make the teardrops start.<SEP>Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?(<SEP>Cold, cold heart)<SEP>There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me.<SEP>But now I know your heart is shackled to that memory.<SEP>The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart.<SEP>Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?(<SEP>Cold, cold heart)<SEP>Fade
