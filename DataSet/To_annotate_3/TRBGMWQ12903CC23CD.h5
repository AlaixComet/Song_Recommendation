Peel this flesh from my face ripping you from my mind.<SEP>Pull back the layers of skin.<SEP>Knee deep in piss.<SEP>Crawling in spit.<SEP>I thirst for life.<SEP>I've watched this passion slip through my fingers.<SEP>Prayers of these few parish in the clouds of emotion.<SEP>Feed my depression with ain and excursion.<SEP>Drop the hammer on life.<SEP>Stone this tired soul and caste this body to rot.<SEP>Taste the life.<SEP>Greet this pain with open arms.<SEP>The blood is life and it shall be mine.<SEP>I envy you
