Bring it on what you got Tonight you're my dart She says keep it tight You sure what I did You hold I commit You take what I owe You know some ain't right Tonight you're my dart She say keep it tight Come home some ain't nice Tonight lost in sight Can't take, take no more I believe a beat like thunder You're moving on The crowd go wild
