If I have wounded any soul today if I have caused one foot to go astray<SEP>If I have walked in my own willful way dear Lord forgive<SEP>If I have uttered idol words or fame if I have turned aside from want or pain<SEP>Yes I offend some other through the strain dear Lord forgive<SEP>Forgive the sins I have confessed to Thee forgive the secret sins I do not see<SEP>Oh guide me love me and my keeper be dear Lord forgive
