I used to go down to the Mill Creek<SEP>When I was only nine or ten<SEP>I’d run trot lines in the muddy water<SEP>I’d watch the leaves riding the wind<SEP>It was there I smoked my first Marlboro<SEP>It was there I kissed Laurie Jones<SEP>I’d lie in the tall grass for hours<SEP>I’d walk in the shallows, I’d skim those stones<SEP>And one day I was climbing in the railroad trestle<SEP>I heard the sound of a coming train<SEP>Man it was on me like a rolling thunder<SEP>Lit a fear inside I can’t explain<SEP>Sent me running, sent me screaming<SEP>Like a wild man through the tall grass<SEP>Trying to make it back home<SEP>And it was then I ran into that stranger<SEP>With his suitcase and his walking cane<SEP>He put his hand on my little shoulder<SEP>And since that day I ain’t been the same<SEP>He sends me running, sends me screaming<SEP>Down a freeway, down a runway<SEP>Trying to make it back home<SEP>And here I stand in this darkened hallway<SEP>My babies sleeping, dreaming soft and low<SEP>I feel his hand on my shoulder<SEP>Like that day down down by the Mill Creek long ago
