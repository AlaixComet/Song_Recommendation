I wish my mind wouldn't argue with my heart, It splits the day apart, Into time well spent, and time just thrown away,<SEP>I wish my heart would please make up my mind, I'm wasting so much time, Gotta catch a glimpse of how it's gonna be.<SEP>When finally, I look inside your eyes and see,<SEP>Reflections of yourself in me, The way you always said it would be, When finally, I'm loving you like you love me, It happened oh so easily, I looked at you and it came to me,<SEP>Finally.<SEP>This Ferris wheel just keeps on spinning round, Playing mind games with the ground, Can we stop this time, or must we go again, I see you standing waiting just outside, Come and get me off this ride, Wanna lose myself in being here with you.<SEP>When finally, I look inside your eyes and see,<SEP>Reflections of yourself in me, The way you always said it would be, When finally, I'm loving you like you love me, It happened oh so easily, I looked at you and it came to me, Finally.
