I'm starting to feel We stay together out of fear of dying alone<SEP>I've been slipping through the years My old clothes don't fit like they once did<SEP>So they hang like ghosts of the people I've been<SEP>It's like my heart can't be tamed<SEP>And I fall in love every day and I feel like a fool<SEP>I have to face the truth That no one could ever look at me like you do<SEP>Like I'm something worth holding on to<SEP>And there's times I think of leaving<SEP>But it's something I'll never do'<SEP>Cause you can do better than me<SEP>But I can't do better than you<SEP>You can do better than me<SEP>But I can't do better than you
