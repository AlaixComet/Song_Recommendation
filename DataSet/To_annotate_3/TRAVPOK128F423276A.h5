There's a love that I dream of at night,<SEP>When I'm home by the fireside of thought.<SEP>After her, all the rest don't seem right.<SEP>You should feel all the goodness she's brought.<SEP>If you're wondering just to who she could be,<SEP>Well I promised I not say her name.<SEP>If you settled down here alongside beach,<SEP>I will tell you 'cause I'm not ashamed.<SEP>She's My Lady From South Of Detroit,<SEP>And we met quite a few years ago.<SEP>I remember her beauty, her taste, and her charms<SEP>Oh, how could I forget holding her in my arms?<SEP>She's My Lady From South Of Detroit.<SEP>And even though sometimes she's bad,<SEP>I'm so sorry she's gone 'cause my memory lives on.<SEP>She's the best lover I've ever had.<SEP>She's My Lady From South Of Detroit,<SEP>And we met quite a few years ago.<SEP>I remember her beauty, her taste, and her charms.<SEP>Oh, how could I forget holding her in my arms?<SEP>She's My Lady From South Of Detroit,<SEP>And even though sometimes she's bad,<SEP>I'm so sorry she's gone 'cause my memory lives on.<SEP>She's the best lover I've ever had.<SEP>Oh, My Lady, where are you now?
