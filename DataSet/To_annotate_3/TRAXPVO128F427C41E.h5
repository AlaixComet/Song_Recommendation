Way it's gonna Way it's gonna  Lately I find I'm caught up in these thoughts How will you come to me How will we connect these hearts Are you somewhere near Hidden like a four-leaf clover Are you miles away Are we getting any closer Are we getting any closer  I already see us moving mountains I already see us walking water I already see the clouds we're flying Over and under I already see us having babies Walking through the park and being lazy I already see myself falling in love eternally And I think that's just the way it's gonna be And I think that's just the way it's gonna be  I already see us moving mountains And I think that's just the way it's gonna be I already see us walking water And I think that's just the way it's gonna be  Being with you Is a like a scene from a dream in heaven I feel you running through All my senses Will you taste like rain Can I breathe you like air Will I lose myself in your arms somewhere  I already see us moving mountains I already see us walking water I already see the clouds we're flying Over and under I can really see us having babies Walking through the park and being lazy I already see myself falling in love eternally And I think that's just the way it's gonna be I think that's just the way it's gonna be  And I know and I know and I know Love can move a mountain And I know and I know It's gonna be even better than I imagined Putting all my trust in you Putting all my trust in you We'll make this dream come true  I can really see us having babies Walking through the park and being lazy I already see myself falling in love eternally And I think that's just the way it's gonna be And I think that's just the way it's gonna be  I already see us moving mountains The way it's gonna be I already see us walking water The way it's gonna be I can really see us having babies The way it's gonna be I already see myself falling in love  Meant to be I already see us moving mountains The way it's gonna be  I already see us walking water To me The way it's gonna be I can really see us having babies<SEP>The way it's gonna be
