Whilst his mother's womb contained the growing Baal<SEP>Even then the sky was waiting quiet and pale<SEP>Naked, young, immensely marvellous<SEP>Like Baal loved it, when he came to us<SEP>That same sky remained with him in joy and care<SEP>Even when Baal slept peaceful and unaware<SEP>At night a lilac sky, a drunken Baal<SEP>Turning pious as the sky grows pale<SEP>So through hospital, cathedral, whiskey bar<SEP>Baal kept moving onwards and just let things go<SEP>When Baal's tired, boys, Baal cannot fall far<SEP>He will have his sky down there below<SEP>When the sinners congregate in shame together<SEP>Baal lay naked, revelling in their distress<SEP>Only sky, a sky that will go on forever<SEP>Formed a blanket for his nakedness<SEP>And that lusty girl, the world, who'll laughing yield<SEP>To the men who'll stand the pressure of her thighs<SEP>Sometimes gave him love-bites, such as can't be healed<SEP>Baal survived it, he just used his eyes<SEP>And when Baal saw lots of corpses scattered round<SEP>He felt twice the thrill, despite the lack of room"<SEP>Space enough" said Baal, "then I'll thicken the ground<SEP>Space enough within this woman's womb"<SEP>Any vice for Baal has got its useful side<SEP>It's the man who practices it, he can't abide<SEP>Vices have their point, once you see it as such<SEP>Stick to two for one will be too much<SEP>Slackness, softness are the sort of things to shun<SEP>Nothing could be harder than the quest for fun<SEP>Lots of strength is needed and experience too<SEP>Swollen bellies can embarrass you<SEP>Under gloomy stars and this poor veil of tears<SEP>Baal will graze a pasture till it disappears<SEP>Once it's been digested to the forest's teeth<SEP>Baal trod singing for a well earned sleep<SEP>Baal can spot the vultures in the stormy sky<SEP>As they wait up there to see if Baal will die<SEP>Sometimes Baal pretends he's dead, but vultures swoop<SEP>Baal in silence dines on vulture-soup<SEP>When the dark womb drags him down to its prize<SEP>What's the world still mean to Baal, he's overfed<SEP>So much sky is lurking still behind his eyes<SEP>He'll just have enough sky when he's dead<SEP>Once the Earth's dark womb engulfed the rotting Baal<SEP>Even then the sky was up there, quiet and pale<SEP>Naked, young, immensely marvellous<SEP>Like Baal loved it when he lived with us
