Come on my friends, let's make for the hills<SEP>They say there's gold but I'm looking for thrills<SEP>You can get your hands on whatever we find'<SEP>Cause I'm only coming along for the ride<SEP>Well, you go your way, I'll go mine<SEP>I don't care if we get there on time<SEP>Everybody's searching for something they say<SEP>I'll get my kicks on the way<SEP>Over the mountains, across the sea<SEP>Who knows what may be waitin' for me<SEP>I can sail forever to strange sounding names<SEP>Faces of people and places don't change<SEP>All I have to do is just close my eyes<SEP>To see the seagulls wheeling in those far distant skies<SEP>All I wanna tell you, all I wanna say<SEP>Is count me in on the journey, don't expect me to stay
