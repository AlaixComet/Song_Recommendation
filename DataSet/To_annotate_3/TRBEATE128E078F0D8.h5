Another long and sleepless night You need someone to hold you tight Sometimes love don't know wrong from right Another long and senseless Fight was all you knew they're all the same There's no one left to take the blame What's behind this masquerade How do we win these losin' Games we play, words we say Cutting wounds we know they run so deep Leave it all behind you Or someday love will find you Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you Only lonely -- how much pain does it take It's getting sometimes I don't know When to stop when to go Sometimes we're so afraid to let it show A stolen kiss so out of place It wipes the smile right off your face And when those feelings start We let them go, let them go Games we play, words we say Cutting wounds that run so deep Leave it all behind you Or someday love will find you Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you Only lonely -- so tell me babe, how much pain Can you take before your heart breaks? I got this timebomb ticking in my head This time I think she's gonna blow How can I say get away When I just can't let go Games we play, words we say Cutting wounds that run so... Leave it all behind you Or someday love will find you Only lonely -- I can't stop hurting you Only lonely -- but I can't stop loving you Only lonely -- how much pain does it take
