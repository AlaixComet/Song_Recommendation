Every time it rains I sit at home and wonder why Ever since you said goodbye I felt so all alone Every time it rains Summer showers soak the ground I watch the rain come pouring down I call out your name Every time it rains I hang my head and want to die I don't seem to care that I'm Just not making it on my own Every time it rains Sometimes late at night I close my eyes And pretend that you're here with me Every time it rains I realize just how lonely my life is gonna be Every time it rains Every time I hear the raindrops fall I may say I don't mind it at all But I do Every time it rains Every time I try to tell myself That in time I'll find somebody else But it won't be you Every time it rains Every time it rains
