Nelson<SEP>Sister seagull, oh you're flying me too high<SEP>Feel so dizzy underneath your open skies<SEP>And it's strange the games we play to hide the crime<SEP>Sister seagull, you're the reason I survive<SEP>I am a prisoner who has thrown away the key<SEP>My soul has vanished with a bird who flies so free<SEP>And wings of change have strapped themselves o'er me<SEP>Sister seagull, you're the reason I survive<SEP>I am waiting here for the tide to turn<SEP>And the byways of the air to open<SEP>Will you lead me there, by the broken stairway to the clouds<SEP>To the clouds<SEP>I am a changeling like the wind across the waves<SEP>Though in the end there will be nothing left to save<SEP>I will return one day with all the time you gave<SEP>Sister seagull, you're the reason I survive<SEP>I survive<SEP>I survive
