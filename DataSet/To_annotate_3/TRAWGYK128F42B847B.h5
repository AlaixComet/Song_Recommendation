I remember Saturdays helping Mama in her kitchen<SEP>Conversations prying, baking with passing down the wisdom<SEP>She said babygirl you're a queen and this is how you should be treated<SEP>Words she washed with tears and planted in my soul<SEP>Can we just go back to the simple kinda living?<SEP>Can we just go back and maybe start from the beginning?<SEP>Back to better days, when love was for the giving<SEP>Can we just go back to the way we were?<SEP>Mama said there was a time when brothers were each others keepers<SEP>Sisters held each other close till there was nothing left between them<SEP>Back when a song was a song you could sing along didn't matter how long<SEP>Just as long as it spoke to ya, sung to ya<SEP>Do you know what I mean?<SEP>Now I'm chasing rainbows and dreams,<SEP>Trying hard to believe<SEP>This is how it could be<SEP>Yesterday was yesterday, tomorrow's just a day away<SEP>By then it may be too late, maybe we can start today
