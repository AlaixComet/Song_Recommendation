Shafts of morning dew, fade to dusk<SEP>Fires in the distance, make shadows dance<SEP>Under this Blood Red Sky, a million martyrs died<SEP>And beneath the pale moon's face<SEP>They shall Again Arise...<SEP>Some things are best left in dreams<SEP>Reality, can be a cruel mistress<SEP>Are your lessons learnt?...<SEP>Chapters close, veins collapse<SEP>A passage ends,<SEP>A rite is earned...<SEP>Their Blood hath quenched the land<SEP>Their spirit has set the stone<SEP>And forever the Pagan lands shall cry<SEP>With a heart so heavy......<SEP>And limbs so weary<SEP>Let no man for his sins atone our days of Glory have gone...
