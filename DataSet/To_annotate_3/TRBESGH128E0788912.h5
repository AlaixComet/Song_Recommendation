One morn I awakened<SEP>A new sun was shining<SEP>The sky was a Kingdom<SEP>All covered in blood<SEP>The moon and the stars<SEP>Where the troops that lay conquered<SEP>Like fruit left to wither<SEP>Poor spiritual food And the spears of bright sun<SEP>All brave with it conquest<SEP>Did hover unearthly<SEP>In banners of fire<SEP>I kneit in the garden<SEP>Awash with the dawning<SEP>And a voice came so brightly<SEP>I covered my eyes Thank you for giving<SEP>This bright new morning<SEP>So steeped seemed the evening<SEP>In darkness and blood<SEP>There'll be no sadness<SEP>There'll be no sorrow<SEP>There'll be no road too narrow<SEP>There'll be a new day<SEP>And it's today<SEP>For us
