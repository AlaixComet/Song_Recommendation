Have you been gone for long?"<SEP>I just kicked off my jeans and I held her close I held her all night long<SEP>I tried to sleep but in my mind I heard that song<SEP>Like a friend in need the melody keeps me hanging on<SEP>The radio saved my life tonight<SEP>Old song that that D<SEP>J played made me feel alright<SEP>Made it home by my dashboard light<SEP>The radio saved my life tonight<SEP>The radio saved my life tonight<SEP>The sad song that the D<SEP>J played made me feel alright<SEP>As I drove down that lonesome highway just me and my dashboard light<SEP>The radio saved my life tonight<SEP>The radio saved my life tonight<SEP>Old song that that D<SEP>J played made me feel alright<SEP>I made it home by my dashboard light<SEP>The radio saved my life tonight<SEP>The radio saved my life tonight<SEP>The radio saved my life tonight<SEP>The radio saved my life tonight
