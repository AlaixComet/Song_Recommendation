Stop my flight to fight and die and take a stand to change my life, so savage with red desperation<SEP>I clench my hands, you draw your claws, a hidden rage consumes my heart, fuelled by years of wasted time, I close my eyes and tense myself<SEP>And screaming, throw myself in fury, over the edge and into your blood<SEP>Tear at flesh and rip at skin and smash at doubt, I have to break you, fury drives my vicious blows, I see you fall but still I strike you<SEP>Again and again your body falls, the movement is sharp and clear and pure and gone, I stop and kneel beside you, drained of everything but pain<SEP>Screaming throw myself in fury, over the edge and into your blood<SEP>Into your blood<SEP>Kiss you once and see you writhe. Hold you close and hear you cry<SEP>Kiss your eyes and finish your life. Kiss your eyes. Finish your life<SEP>Again and again your body falls, the movement is sharp and clear and pure and gone<SEP>I stop and kneel beside you, knowing I'll murder you again tonight<SEP>Knowing I'll murder you again. Knowing I'll murder you again<SEP>Knowing I'll murder you again. Knowing I'll murder you again tonight
