Mine is a lonely one, I forgot to have fun, standing under the street light<SEP>Ever so nervously, people lookin' down on me, telling me it's all right<SEP>If it were up to me I'd tear down this whole city, what's all this shit here for?<SEP>I give you my heart, but you just say I make you feel like a whore<SEP>All this trouble just to die, all this trouble's only temporary, it's temporary, temporary<SEP>Took away his power but he hides a tiny flower in the corner of his jail cell<SEP>Never been outside he just can't hide, he'd just assume be in hell<SEP>Get off the fucking telephone, why'd you hate to be alone, paranoid of death and love<SEP>Ever so patiently we sit upon our sinking ship waiting for the black dove<SEP>All this trouble just to die, all this trouble's only temporary, it's temporary, temporary<SEP>Sad that I could make it, glad that I could fake, sorry but I got to go<SEP>I ain't afraid of cryin', ain't afraid of dyin'. ain't afraid of what I don't know
