Take the ribbon from your hair<SEP>Shake it loose and let it fall<SEP>Layin' soft upon my skin<SEP>Like the shadows on the wall<SEP>Come and lay down by my side<SEP>Till the early mornin' light<SEP>All I'm takin' is your time<SEP>Help me make it through the night<SEP>I don't care who's right or wrong<SEP>I don't try to understand<SEP>Let the devil take tomorrow<SEP>Lord tonight I need a friend<SEP>Yesterday is dead and gone<SEP>And tomorrow's out of sight<SEP>And it's sad to be alone
